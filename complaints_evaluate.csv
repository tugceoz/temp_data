He expired on XXXX/XXXX/15 - approximately 20 months prior to the end of his lease. 
He paid his XXXX lease payment. 
I am his son and co-executor of his will. 
I contacted Ally bank in the days after his death and was instructed to FAX his death certificate and proof of executorship, which I did. 
After confirming receipt of these documents Ally stated that further payments would not be automatically withdrawn from my father 's accounts. 
I returned the car to the dealership, returned the plates to the DMV, and contacted the auto insurance company. 
I have since received notice that I owe {$8800.00} to Ally. They have explained this as the difference between their estimated value of the car and what they received for it at auction. 
I do not have a copy of the lease contact. 
I was not informed by Ally when I initially contacted them that I would be responsible for this sum. I was not informed that I may want to keep the vehicle, pay the lease payments ( which would have totaled about {$10000.00} over the remaining 20 months of the lease ). 
If I was aware of this I would have kept the car, made the lease payments and driven it through the lease period. 
Now the bank gets just about the entire term of the lease paid to them but was able to repossess and then sell the vehicle at a much higher residual value than it would have had had it been returned to them at the end of the original lease period. I could have spent just a little more money over the next 20 months and had the car. Instead the bank has the car and I have to spend almost the same amount of money.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1667876

As my clients began to receive statements from Chase, they were surprised to find that the new loan balance had grown to approximately {$310000.00} -- an amount greater than the original debt.

My clients then filed a complaint with the Arizona Attorney General 's Office, questioning if the terms of the modifications were predatory. Several days later, Chase sent notice that the debt was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX.

1/16/16,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,NY,115XX,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I received a notification from Nationstar Mortgage informing me they had no record of my renters insurance for the coop apartment I own. Included was notice they purchased insurance in my absence, placed a balance due on my escrow account and intended to raise my monthly mortgage payment to cover this charge. I never received any prior notice of this, and I do in fact have current insurance I purchased from XXXX which I renew each year. After contacting Nationstar, a rep told me since they had taken over my mortgage from XXXX, some things were not settled and still being worked out, but they had no record of my coverage and claim to have contacted me previously by mail. I asked to e-mail proof of my coverage to them to resolve this, and they said it must be faxed. I asked to speak to a manager, was put on hold and hung up on seconds later. I faxed proof of my current, valid and fully paid insurance payment, with a letter requesting written notice of resolution of this matter, and have received no response. A follow up call to Nationstar resulted in me being hung up on XXXX without ever even reaching a rep after long waits to speak to a rep. I 've owned this coop apartment for over 7 years and never had any problem with this insurance issue when XXXX held my mortgage. It should not be my responsibility to fix Nationstar 's errors when they purchased my mortgage, but I have made a good faith effort to do so. Nationstar is difficult to contact, uncooperative ( how could they possibly refuse an e-mail confirmation of insurance coverage in this day and age? ), has failed to respond to my providing the required documents and has entered into an insurance contract to cover my property, without my knowledge or consent, which should be illegal. I am requesting that my account be cleared of this matter. I want the escrow balance removed from my account, the related intended mortgage payment increase to be removed and this insurance coverage purchased by Nationstar to be canceled, all at no cost to me as none of this is the result of my error. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",,,Web,Closed,Yes,Yes,1745812

I 'm in need of assistance. I 'm hoping you can see to it that this gets resolved. 

XXXX XXXX had the XXXX lien on my property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX. The property went to foreclosure in XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was the last reported date on my credit report revealing I was 120 days past due. This was my last time since negative. 

XX/XX/XXXX I discovered XXXX was reporting that I had a monthly obligation of {$23000.00} on this old debt. This was reflecting in my monthly DTI. I disputed this information through Experian XX/XX/XXXX when my Credit Score was XXXX. I have been rebuilding my credit since the foreclosure ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and imagined that this erroneously large monthly obligation 's removal would only help me. Instead, XXXX XXXX eliminated the monthly obligation and updated the status to a charge off as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Now my credit report says I have a RECENT LATE as of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - but the last time I was late with payments was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX recent reporting of my charge off occurred in XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX because of my recent complaint. They updated their records to reflect CHARGE OFF XX/XX/XXXX. Their adherence to erroneous reporting makes lenders and other affiliates assume I was recently late on my obligations. I DO NOT HAVE A CHARGE OFF AS OF XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. But as you can see on the evidence provided I was NOT late on any payments in XX/XX/XXXX. ( I have n't been late on any payments since XX/XX/XXXX. ) How could I be late on an account that has been closed since XXXX? Compass wrote that the balance is past due as of XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX but I was 120 days past due from XX/XX/XXXX. 
LENDERS will NOT approve me for a mortgage because it says I was recently CHARGED OFF. How can I now have XXXX CHARGE OFFS on XXXX ACCOUNT? 
I was recently declined a mortgage because of this reporting. Even though the notes say the Charge Off will drop in XX/XX/XXXX suggesting it is an old charge off their reporting is erroneous and inaccurate and make it appear that this is recent. I DO NOT HAVE A CHARGE OFF IN XX/XX/XXXX OR XX/XX/XXXX. THIS ACCOUNT IS FROM XX/XX/XXXX. CLOSED IN XX/XX/XXXX. YOU CA N'T REPORT ON A CLOSED ACCOUNT. 

Per Experian my Time Since Negative is .1 years ( point one years ). Please help. I have n't been late since XX/XX/XXXX and it is all related to the foreclosure. 

Please help. The Time Since Negative is completely inaccurate. Please remove the negative date and have it report accurately to reflect that the time I was last negative was XX/XX/XXXX. 

Thank you kindly.

12/1/16,FREEDOM MORTGAGE COMPANY,CA,920XX,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"XX/XX/2016 I purchased my home and my loan was sold and serviced by Freedom Mortgage. The mortgage was an FHA loan. In XX/XX/XXXX I received an offer from Freedom Mortgage for the FHA Streamline refinance program and I applied in order to reduce my rate. Initially, the closing was going to occur in XX/XX/XXXX until I was notified the program requires 6 months of on time payments. Given my mortgage was new the 6th payment would not be made until XX/XX/XXXX. I remained in communication with the loan processor XXXX XXXX, who told me everything was fine and once the XX/XX/XXXX payment posted we 'd move to closing. My payments are setup to pull automatically every month on XX/XX/XXXX and have been since the loan 's inception. My Bank account can show this. On XX/XX/XXXX I followed up with XXXX to notify her the payment had been pulled. Around XX/XX/XXXX my wife, who is a co-signer, received a Credit Denial letter. I myself have not received a decline letter. The reason for the denial of credit was due to a late mortgage payment. This is inaccurate and they should know better since they can see my loan payments are pulled by their system every month automatically. When I inquired about this the processor pointed to the loan officer, then loan officer pointed to the processor, and then the processor pointed to the underwriters. Nobody was willing to admit a mistake was made and to correct it. Finally I got a manager 's information from XXXX, her name was XXXX. She too was of no help and would not recognize their mistake. 
This is unacceptable practice. The denial reason is bogus and easily corrected if they would simply check their system and confirm the loan payments are automatically drawn each month. I called their customer service to confirm we were current, and they concurred. Clearly a disconnect between their departments and information between the two. 
What is even more upsetting is the rate lock has expired now and with the rising interest rates over the past few weeks I will not get the rate which was originally locked at 3.75 % even if they were to reopen the application. This rate reduction would have saved me over {$25000.00} in interest and I intended to keep my payments the same at which I pay today. This would have eliminated close to 4 years off my mortgage.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2232063

We have always titled all of our properties in the name of our trust since that time including our residence at which had a HELOC with Wells Fargo Bank. In XXXX we bought a new primary residence and unfortunately made the bad decision to finance it with Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . Besides the fact that the origination process was horrible and their fraudulent flood department that is part of Home Equity made us get unnecessary flood insurance ( subject of previously filed complaints ) I am now being harassed by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . about holding my property in the name of a trust. First I got a letter stating that I needed to fill out forms, notarize them and include copies of my trust pages which I did. Now I received a second letter from XXXX XXXX, a VP ( that according to customer service does n't have a phone number I can use to speak with her so I 'm not sure if she is a robo signer ) stating that I have to have a modification agreement recorded against my account. When I called Customer Service to speak with them they said that my account would be restricted if I did n't complete the forms ( it is already restricted due to a short sale in XXXX ) and that if I do n't comply and keep my account in good standing they are going to take actions including possible foreclosure. 

I continue to have problems with this bank even though I have over XXXX accounts with them. CA state law allows for individuals to have properties held in the name of a trust and still have a loan on them yet WFB seems to think that they can usurp state law and create their own rules. Also it 's important to note that WFB does n't have a problem with the Conventional XXXX loan that they service since that is n't their money but when they have a portfolio loan they create complex billing situations ( see other complaints about how they steal money by misapplying payments ) and harass me about my estate planning.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1833365

So of course off went the car. I called lobel the next morning to resolve this and that was the WORST experience in my life. They are rude, inconsiderate human beings. I explained to them very nicely that it was mix up and on my bank account. I told them I apologize. I told them I called right when it happened and at that time that person was very understanding and I told them I would pay it on the first. He said no problem I will mark your account. Will ... ... .guess what???? Nope! They would not listen, told me in order for me to get my car back I would have to pay my loan in full. I asked to talk to management no! I called the corporate number they sent me back to the other number. I asked to talk to management they put me on hold for XXXX minutes then call got dropped. I called to talk to the lebal department got put on hold again for a very long time then of course call got dropped again. They will not let you talk to management. Yes! I understand this is a new loan, but I explained to them the situation I went through and they did n't even care. I explained all of this would of been avoided if they would of sent the repoe company some kind of information on how much I owec cuz I would of paid the man.i even offered to pay what was owed in the rear and the very rude lady refused it stating in order to get the car back I have to pay it in full. I asked to talk to the manager that made that decision and she told me no. I asked to be transfered to corporate and with a XXXX voice and XXXX this is corporate.

3/15/18,BMO HARRIS BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,IN,462XX,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"This matter concerns a dispute with BMO Harris Bank over a NSF ( not sufficient funds ) charge of {$36.00} on XX/XX/XXXX on a personal checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, an authorized payment of {$65.00} was taken out of our personal checking account which put the account into a negative balance. I happened to learn of this situation very early the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, by accident, as I happened to check the account on line. I then physically went to a BMO branch and made a teller deposit sufficient to cover the negative balance at approximately noon, XX/XX/XXXX. Then, several hours later, after the curative deposits were made, I received an e-mail notice from BMO Harris at about XXXX XXXX advising that, due to the negative balance, it was reversing the {$65.00} payment, and assessing a {$36.00} charge. 

I then contacted BMO Harris on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a "" manager '' by the name of XXXX XXXX to request a courtesy reversal of the {$36.00} charge based on the prior deposits which provided sufficient funds to cover the {$65.00} payment. I note, too, that while BMO Harris system does provide an immediate e-mail notice to advise of the NSF charge, the BMO system provides no notice of the negative balance problem in the first place to allow timely curative action. I simply discovered the problem by accident the morning of XXXX. 

In the conversation with XXXX XXXX, he advised that he must decline any reversal of this {$36.00} NSF charge for 2 reasons. His first reason was that the NSF charge was imposed on XXXX, before the cash deposit was made. However, my on-line bank statement clearly shows the imposition of this fee on XXXX ( not XXXX ) and clearly shows the cash deposits prior in time to the reversal of the {$65.00} payment and imposition of the charge. Additional, BMO 's e-mail notice of these actions was provided at approximately XXXX XXXX, the evening of XXXX and state in the body of the e-mail that BMO 's actions were taken "" today '', not on XXXX and, again after the curative deposits were made. 

XXXX XXXX 's second reason for declining a reversal of the {$36.00} charge is that I've had NSF charges in the past. And that is true -- BMO has indeed imposed NSF fees on our account in the past. In that regard, in XXXX, we attempted to set up over-draft protection for the account in question, which took several months & repeated efforts to set up correctly. In the first instance, BMO did not link our accounts properly, the over-draft protection failed to operate and resulted in NSF fees. This was finally corrected. In the 2nd instance, we learned that there is federal bank limitation which prohibits intra-account fund transfers more than 6 times in a 30 day period, which ( with our BMO accounts ) resulting in failed transfers of funds and additional NSF fees. ] Here, I'm not seeking to "" re-litigate '' any past NSF fees. Here, I'm only seeking a courtesy adjustment of the XX/XX/XXXX {$36.00} fee based on ( 1 ) the XXXX prior cash deposits we'd made to address the NSF problem and ( 2 ) BMO 's policy of not providing notice of NSF problems in a manner calculated to allow the customer to address the problem timely. In a larger picture way, I personally believe that BMO 's NSF fee charges and policies are specifically designed to maximize the fees charged to the customers, to be difficult for customers to navigate, and to increase BMO Harris ' revenue from such fees, all in an unfair and inappropriate manner. I also can advise that we've had no similar problems with our banking relationships at XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX -- only at BMO Harris.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX our real estate agent along with our attorney filed an offer with Wells Fargo on our property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, CT XXXX. 
After going through the required procedures on XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo notified our Attorney stating that the given offer did not meet there minimum requirements of {$240000.00} ( please see attached letter stating such. ) the offer submitted was for {$270000.00} ( see attached offer ) after all the fee 's, the offer exceeded their expectations by {$510.00}. Our Attorney at least once a week contacted Wells Fargo to get some clarification on this with no success, nobody could give us an answer. 
On XXXX XXXX ( 2 months later ) our attorney called yet again to try and get an answer, this is where we found out that ( Wells Fargo ) XXXX in the liquidations Dept. stated that as of XXXX XXXX the system showed that the file was removed from the short sale review and no reason was listed, our attorney than left messages with a XXXX XXXX ( preservation specialist assigned to our case ) and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX 's supervisor ) and received no response. On XXXX XXXX they were able to speak to a XXXX who stated that our account became active in the short sale review on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and gave our attorney a list of requested documents needed. 
Wells Fargo CLOSED the original short sale request after 6 months with NO notification and NO reason and then REOPENED it! at which point we were required to start all over from the beginning!! Needless to say the potential buyers backed out because of the banks negligence. We are truly disgusted and appalled that a business can be run this way. 
On XXXX XXXX, another offer ( see attached ) had been submitted for a little bit more money than the first offer, which means the requirements are again EXCEEDING the banks exceptions by even more. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we received notification from Wells Fargo that they have accepted the current offer but changes the closing cost credit from {$6000.00} to {$2700.00}, needless to say the couple that put the offer in did n't like that and they backed out. 
At this point we filed for a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure as Wells Fargo denied us because they stated the house was not maintained. We moved south in XXXX XXXX, we had people maintaining the house. XXXX XXXX we had someone go to property to winterize the home, this is when we found out that someone had seized the home and changed the locks.

We were in our home ten years and was never late on a payment, not once. I was laid off my job of XXXX years and asked over an over again to refinance. I was told no by XXXX. During this time the payment went up over XXXX dollars because of the type of loan. That is one of the reasons we wanted to refinance the loan before this happened. We were also told you have never missed a payment so they are not going to help you refinance. We used all of our savings to keep things current. We tried next to do a modification and was told the same thing. Once they realized we were going ahead with the modification the loan was sold to SLS, than the problems really began. I started back working at half the salary so it was hard catching up. While processing the modification SLS continued to say they either did not receive documents or they needed them again. This happed every time we would send the documentation, they would say it was received to turn around and say they did not have it. This went on for over a year before they finally said no to the modification. We decided to do a short sell on the home. We have had XXXX offers. XXXX was XXXX short of what they wanted so they said no. The second was a cash offer for more than what they asked. XXXX would not agree to the short sale and kept things in limbo, meanwhile they stated they did not care if we foreclosed on the home or filed bankruptcy. The couple buying the home needed to close soon because she had XXXX XXXX. XXXX would not agree with any option that was put out there so the couple found another home. The next day XXXX called and said they would agree after we made a complaint but it was to late. A week later we received a third offer for over the amount asked. The persons buying the home ask if they can close as soon as possible ( within 45 days ) because they are closing on their home. Now SLS continues to drag and now decided they want more money. How can you keep doing this. It is as if they do n't want to really sell the home. This has gone on now for a year and a half and is affecting my health. They have not returned my calls and know that the family wants to close soon. I am not sure what to do next. We had excellent credit and always say our bills. We would like to sell the home so that we can move on. We do not want it to go the house to go into foreclosure.

3/18/17,"EQUIFAX, INC.",IA,503XX,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Inadequate help over the phone,"I filed an online dispute with Equifax after reviewing my credit report, for unauthorized inquiries and an incorrect balance. I previously disputed the inquiries as incorrect, approximately 4-6 months ago, when I noticed there were "" hard pulls '' from companies I do not conduct business with. I wrote a letter disputing the inaccuracies, and at that time asked to opt-out of pre-screened marketing. Equifax did take me off of the pre-screened marketing, but they put a fraud alert on my account, which prevented me from accessing my credit report or applying for credit. The inquiries were never taken off, and I was told by an Equifax representative to file a police report, before they could further assist with the inquires. Furthermore, my account balance is incorrectly being reported by XXXX. I filed a dispute with a representative, and was told to send in supporting documentation to assist in the dispute process. The initial case was re-investigated by another Equifax representative, because when XXXX updated the balance, it was still incorrect. As of yesterday, yet another Equifax representative said she was going to cancel my re-investigation ( without my consent ) because it was already updated by XXXX. I advised her that the information was to be re-investigated. She said it was Equifax 's policy to not have more than one open dispute for the same dispute, meaning they are not allowing me to file a re-investigation. Lastly, I accessed my consumer report today with Equifax and I noticed there is a "" Consumer Statement '' on my report that was not provided by me. The consumer statement was placed by an Equifax representative and reads ( copied from my credit report ) : XX/XX/XXXX CONSUMER SENT IN DOCS TO VERIFY THAT SSHE DOES CURRENTLY HAVE A XXXX BALANCE WITH XXXX FOR THE ACCOUNT THOSE DOCS WERE SENT IN ON XX/XX/XXXX THE CONFIRMATION FOR THOSE DOCUMENTS XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. It is my understanding that the consumer statement is a statement from me and not from Equifax. I never requested a consumer statement, and their comment shows that Equifax had proof as of XX/XX/XXXX that my balance was truly at a XXXX balance, yet they did not update the balance, they simply closed the re-investigation. Numerous occasions I have called and received conflicting information from Equifax representatives, and supervisors. When calling in to their customer service number, when I am transferred to their "" foreign '' or outsourced phone queue, I have been given such incorrect information, that now I ask to be transferred to a representative in the United States.

They acknowledged receiving the letter and they said they will answer it. I gave them 10 days in my letter to answer me but it has been three weeks and I have not heard from them. They are now avoiding any attempts that I make to contact them. Since then I closed my account with them and opened a new one in a different bank because TD bank was obviously too vulnerable to a scam and yet would not acknowledge their mistake nor help me get my money back.

We were just told that the above file was closed out rather than an extension being issued as requested on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX from my firm was told on the phone, on a recorded line that we were okay to close on the XX/XX/XXXX - a day after the approval letter expired. Friday the XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday and therefore did not count for the XXXX disclosure guidelines so we needed to close on the XX/XX/XXXX. 

We closed on the XX/XX/XXXX and the wire was then sent out and the attached documents were sent in to Ocwen. The deed was recorded, the buyer 's loan finalized - no rescission period in Maryland - so the loan has already been sold off to a new owner and then Ocwen returned the wire and asked that we change the XXXX to XX/XX/2016. This is a TRID violation so the title company would not back-date the XXXX after closing on the XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am filing this as a CFPB complaint. We are going to tell the title company to send back the wire as it should have been accepted the first time. Ocwen can not give us approval to close the day after on the XX/XX/XXXX and then a week later tell us that we could not close on the XX/XX/XXXX. This will be a title insurance issue and the buyers and the sellers will sue. 

This needs to be rectified XXXX. We can not re-submit the short sale package - Ocwen needs to do what they said they would do and honor the closing from the XX/XX/XXXX.

I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my full written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them. 
I researched a dispute letter online and just used that to complete my dispute. So I guess it is possible that I may have missed something. I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report. 
I would also like to know what made my letter "" suspicious '' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that was inappropriate? 
I would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them? 
I do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts.

After thinking about it and talking with him about the subject I decided to do so, but I also knew the risk of doing this because co-signing for anyone is a risk no matter who it is. I did n't put any money down nor did I pay any mortgage payments on either of the apartment homes. My nephew was paying all of the mortgage payments and his wife was making sure that the apartments were kept in shape and rented. About XXXX years ago my nephew decided that he did n't want to be married anymore, and asked for a divorce which left the houses without anyone to look after them, and even though he was able to pay the payments and rent out the apartments he decided to sell the houses. After working with a real estate agent, gathering paper work and other things I checked in with my nephew to make sure that all was going well with the selling of the homes. This was at a time when the housing market was still in pretty bad shape so the homes stayed on the market for quite some time, and from time to time I would hear from the real estate agent that was working with my nephew about paperwork to sell the places. In XXXX of this year "" 2015 '' I decided to buy a new truck, and that is when I found out that I had XXXX foreclosures on my credit, but could n't get a hold of my nephew because he is overseas working as a government contractor so I contacted the real estate agent to see what had happened with the selling of the XXXX properties only to find that the houses had went into foreclosure and the houses had been sold. The real estate agent assumed that my nephew and also the banks had been in contact with me about what was going on. I was astonished to find that not only did my nephew not call me, but neither of the banks ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ) contacted me about the mortgage payments not being made. After pulling my credit and looking at the information on the XXXX loans from these XXXX mortgage companies I have filed disputes with all XXXX credit reporting agencies. I am realistic about what my nephew did, but I am in shock that neither of the banks contacted me the ( owner/con-signer ) of the mortgages to let me know what was going on with these properties because something could have been done to save not only XXXX but both of the properties from being foreclosed and sold. The disputes with all XXXX credit monitoring agencies was put in, but only XXXX agreed to remove the history from the credit report, and that is all that I was asking them to do is remove the credit history from the credit reports because the houses did go into foreclosure, but the mortgage companies did n't do their due-diligence in contacting me ( owner/co-signer ) about these properties. XXXX did remove the history, but left the information stating that the house was foreclosed on and my credit is actually good with them. XXXX and XXXX did not take into consideration that the mortgage companies did n't do their due-diligence in contacting me, and have kept all the history which has pulled my credit rating down, and this is what I would like to change with these XXXX credit monitoring companies the removal of the history from my credit report in dealing with these XXXX mortgage companies. Any assistance that you can provide me with these XXXX companies ( XXXX and XXXX ) would be greatly appreciated. Once again I would like to say that what 's done is done, and I wo n't be doing any co-signing for anyone again, but the XXXX mortgage companies did n't do their due-diligence and contact me ( not a letter, phone call, or email ).

3/23/15,"Altisource Portfolio Solutions, S.à r.l.",AK,995XX,Debt collection,Credit card,Communication tactics,Frequent or repeated calls,"Background : In XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX I began falling behind on payments to XXXX XXXX. A substantial balance had accumulated because of recent large unforeseen expenses - vehicle repairs which resulted from our truck being rear-ended. The insurance company unexpectedly denied claims for over XXXX in repairs. We met minimum payments in XXXX XXXX - {$3100.00}, XXXX XXXX - {$3100.00}, XXXX XXXX - {$2300.00}, XXXX XXXX - XXXX, XXXX. XXXX - {$1100.00} and XXXX. {$4300.00}. we were able to meet these obligations only by closing a small IRA and borrowing. The debt situation began to grow serious. The XXXX minimum payment was {$3100.00} and I was unable to pay it. We paid {$500.00}. There were multiple phone calls and conversations with XXXX XXXX. In XXXX I wrote to XXXX requesting that they grant a XXXX month grace period since I had been a customer for over 20 years and had just become eligible for Social Security Benefits ( and would therefore have additional income ). The XXXX SS benefit check would arrive the last week in XXXX and I promised substantial monthly payments from then until the balance was satisfied. I sent a payment of {$1000.00} on XXXX XXXX and, at the end of the XXXX cycle, XXXX XXXX closed the account and sent it to collection. 
Phone calls from a collection agency began XXXX XXXX, XXXX and repeated multiple times each day. They were all from "" unavailable '' or "" restricted '' numbers. My XXXX conversation with a representative at "" XXXX '' was XXXX XXXX. I sent a letter ( certified return receipt ) requesting that they ceased calling me and send validation / documentation of the debt. I did not receive this documentation so I sent a XXXX request XXXX days later. A short while later ( XXXX XXXX ) I began receiving multiple phone calls from another collection agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX After numerous phone calls ( with a call center in XXXX ) and another letter requesting validation of the debt, I did finally receive the documentation on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I then called XXXX and spoke with a representative called, XXXX. We hammered out a verbal agreement. 
A "" settlement '' was not possible because of our limited financial resources. I needed to make payments. They wanted at least 10 % down. I wanted to put {$500.00} down. The end result was an agreement of {$890.00} down ( which XXXX stated he was able to achieve under "" hardship "" conditions ) and monthly payments of {$430.00} for 36 months. Except the agreement had to be in XXXX parts - 24 months was as long as they would go. We would need a XXXX agreement for 12 months for the remaining amount. There would be no additional interest on what I owed. I stated that I would send in my own payments and ( on legal advice ) not provide a bank account number and allow them to take automatic payments. I also wanted our agreement in writing before I would send in the XXXX payment. I requested information on the "" clean slate '' offer XXXX was making. XXXX directed me to call the credit reporting number at XXXX XXXX since XXXX could not determine how XXXX would report this account. XXXX told me that a letter outlining what we discussed would be sent to me and I should call him when I received it. This was on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I waited a week ( XXXX XXXX ) and emailed my mail service to forward mail. The packet arrived on XXXX XXXX but there was no letter from XXXX. 
I almost immediately began receiving collection calls from another XXXX #. When I returned the calls I had to start all over with a different office /division of XXXX. I reiterated the terms of the agreement that had been achieved. I dealt with XXXX people at this new office ( XXXX XXXX, then XXXX and finally the "" supervisor '' XXXX XXXX.

10/6/16,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",NH,038XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"Over five years ago, I opened a "" XXXX Checking '' account with Citizens. The account encouraged electronic transactions so, when XXXX were processed, the monthly {$4.00} fee would be waived. All statements would be electronic with email notification. This was perfect for me. I used my work email address for these notices and had a good relationship with the bank. 
In XXXX, I lost my job and my major source of income. My direct deposit days were over and I ceased using the account. 
In XXXX, my XXXX chose to open an account with Citizens, and the teller asked if I had an account ; I told her that I had one years ago but had closed it. She made no comments and continued with opening our XXXX XXXX account. 
I guess I had never closed the account as I thought I had in XXXX - because I received a notice in the mail in XXXX XXXX stating that my account had over {$500.00} in it, that it would be closed due to inactivity, and the funds would be turned over to the state of New Hampshire. I signed the form stating not to close the account and then called the bank to find out what was going on. 
The person I spoke with at Citizens ' call center number was quite helpful. It turns out that a small deposit was made monthly by my former employer to the Citizens account in their error, which was supposed to be sent to a different savings account instead. I had no idea that this deposit was going to Citizens. Despite the fact that my email address had been invalid for many months and likely generated a bounce back for every single communication that Citizens bank sent, I did n't receive postal mail or even a courtesy phone call to inform me of this - ever. Even when the deposits stopped, I was charged fees. And somehow, along the way, I was being charged {$9.00} monthly fee instead of the {$4.00} - a 100 % increase. Not only did I receive no notices via mail or otherwise, but also no notice of the fee change. This fee was deducted for not months but years, and put a significant drain on any money that had been saved. The amount of money taken in fees is comparable to what many people earn in a week. 
A few days later, I visited Citizens branch in downtown XXXX NH to discuss the fees and procedures in person. The account representative was not friendly and placed blame squarely on me. She did not understand my situation and I felt that she was less than helpful. I did leave her with my phone number - and received no call back. A few days later, after no information, I logged in to the electronic banking. There were XXXX fee refunds, and a new fee charge. Oh, and your branch still never contacted me. I came in person to speak with the same representative, waited for almost 30 minutes with no representative to help. Being that I was upset and also burning up my lunch break, I closed the account at the teller line.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2148734

The reason behind my closing the account was due to monthly maintenance fees, yet they have no record of any maintenance fees prior to this supposed charge, if my account had in fact been opened my account would have been charged a maintenance fee for every month prior to this ""transaction"". It is my understanding that once an account is closed, a bank cannot re-open it without the account holders permission. 

  I submitted a dispute and validation request, the information provided seemed weak at best. They sent a response and XXXX statements, spanning three months, the account type is listed as an ""Everyday Checking"" on the final month, although it is listed as ""student checking"" on the prior XXXX months.

After the first deposit XXXX was made available immediately. After the second deposit no money was made available. On XX/XX/2017 I checked my account and noticed a hold was placed on XXXX. I called the bank at about XXXX to inquire about the hold and to verify if this hold would delay my deposits clearing. The first person I spoke with provided information I did n't ask for and then advised a bank teller placed the hold on my account and he could not explain why and I needed to wait until the branch opened to get an answer. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor advised the deposit department placed the hold and I would need to speak with someone from that department. I was transferred. The first person I spoke with in the deposit department again provided information I did not ask for and was irrelevant to my inquiry, when I pressed for an answer about the hold and how it would effect my deposits I was advised she could not explain the hold and I would need to wait until the morning to find out what would happen. She became rude when I asked for a supervisor. I spoke with a supervisor in the deposit department who again advised no one could help, no information could be provided and that notes on the account can not be seen until the transaction either clears/or does n't. I called customer service and immediately asked for a supervisor so that I could file a complaint. The supervisor in customer service insisted she could help, again I was told no notes where available to explain the decision and they could not provide any answers until my deposit either cleared or did n't clear in the morning. I asked to speak with her supervisor and she hung up on me. I called back and the customer service rep who knew my name insisted he could not transfer me until I gave him my name, he was antagonizing. I finally spoke with a supervisor who again stated nothing could be done, no answers could be provided and I would just have to wait until the morning to "" see what would happen ''. I spoke with XXXX different people, none of them could explain why the hold was placed, or how the hold would effect my deposits clearing. I checked my account this morning and the deposits were debited and my account is negative over XXXX.

If there were questions regarding the deposit, I did not receive a phone call so that I could at least attempt to answer any questions the bank may have had. I did not receive an e-mail either. It would have been helpful if at a minimum notes were entered explaining why the hold was placed and whether or not my deposits would have been effected.

This is my 2nd complaint with the CFPB. The first was a joke. Wells Fargo was allowed to respond and close the complaint without anyone checking to see if they actually were right. If your going to have a complaint forum, shouldnt the consumer be allowed documentation proving that their responder is correct. Here we are 5 months later and Wells Fargo is just praying I give up, But I refuse. They have ruined my life, including my marriage of 33 years. I sent a QWR to wells fargo asking for a complete and accurate accounting of my loan from it 's beginning through XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( QWR date ). Their response was a joke. It included a payment history, NPV from my modification attempts, a few letters stating I was denied because I had a mortgage, blank documents, a good faith statement, ( by the way, I want my {$10000.00} it says came to me ) and letters either unsigned, signed by people I 've never heard of, said I was accepted or were addressed to a different customer!? I had asked for standard information pertaining to my loan. ( copy of QWR to be uploaded ) I had asked for the foreclosure sale to be postponed until both parties were satisfied, but found out they were proceeding with the sale anyway on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when the rep called to say he was sending out my answers and closing this and turning my final request for fraudulent documents over to there fraud department. ( Who sent me a packet on identity theft and never returned my calls! ) I called them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( and sent a 2nd QWR ) and told them I did n't have a mortgage and was rudely told yes, yes, you do! The lady wasnt very happy when she had to tell me I was right. She also stated that some XXXX would call me back on my complaints about their reps response to my QWR and 3 days later I 'm still waiting though I did check to see, and the Trustee has cancelled the 3rd sale! I am not saying I do not owe them money. I am saying that they have jerked me around for over 6 months that I could have been making payments. they told me my home had been charged off and then called me a liar. they told me I could not make a payment, that no one would accept them. went to the bank and made a payment and when I went the next month they had foreclosed without notice or anything. Wells Fargo has no idea what they are doing with this WACHOVIA account. They say my requests are too broad. I am saying I never had a security instrument or a deed of trust and never saw XXXX until they sent me a copy XXXX of XXXX. I can walk into a bank and request a copy of my paperwork and they give me my note. ( latest copy XXXX ) they look at it like hmm what is going on and politely send me on my way because they do not want to be involved. If there was a DOT why didnt I see it at signing? Why wasnt I ever given a copy of it or this good faith statement? They keep sending me things Ive never seen before and if I complain they combine it trying to cover themselves and its just a joke because they can not deny the evidence they 've sent to me when we end up in court. Every time I have an issue with them they give me a new rep ... ... wonder what happens to the old XXXX? How does Wells Fargo get away with treating people this way? How can they get away with making their customers deal with all of the untrained, unskilled, rude workers who are just trying to XXXX so they dont lose their jobs? when is someone going to hold Wells Fargo accountable once and for all?? For me they just keep attacking. I got a new bank account, they transferred all my payments EXCEPT IRS and life insurance so guess what I 'm going through now?

2/1/17,Ditech Financial LLC,CA,951XX,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I am forming another compliant against Ditech with the hopes of making it more precise. My problems started when XXXX sold my loan to Greentree/Ditech. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Ditech sent me a letter stating that my escrow overage amount would increase and the shortage was {$890.00}. They stated they would spread it out over a 19 month period ( refer to XXXX page of escrow account disclosure statement ) ; however I sent in the full payment of {$890.00}, check dated XX/XX/XXXX, that cleared my bank ( see enclosed ). When I received my XX/XX/XXXX, statement they showed I owed {$2000.00}, I assumed it was because they had not received my payment in full In the amount of {$890.00} because I did not sent it off until the XXXX of that month. I did call them to let them know I choose to pay in full and not have it added in my monthly payments. Therefore, I informed them I would mail in my regular payment under the XXXX agreement which was {$1900.00} based on the interest rate. My interest rate went up XX/XX/XXXX ; however the effective payment date was XX/XX/XXXX. 

Ditech has been holding my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment in a "" Funds in Suspense Balance, '' in the amt. of {$2100.00}. Please refer to a statement I enclosed ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ). The information is located under account information in the first column. Since that date, every payment I have sent in, Ditech has applied to the previous month ; therefore they state I am one month behind on my mortgage. 

Let 's just say my payments were {$2000.00} for XX/XX/XXXX ; well the amount they are holding in the "" Funds in Suspense Balance '' exceed the amount they stat I owe. 

In addition, I have enclosed just a few of the letter 's Ditech has sent me, dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX stating different amounts that I owe, maybe they can explain those to you because they make no sense to me. If you refer to the analysis report enclosed, the records will show that they paid my escrow amount on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$3100.00}. If you add the balance of {$2700.00} with the {$890.00} payment I mailed in on XX/XX/XXXX ( it cleared my bank on XX/XX/XXXX, please refer to back of check enclosed as well ) the amount total {$3600.00}, which was more than enough with some left over. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Ditech sent me a letter stating they conducted an escrow analysis report, however they did not fracture in the {$890.00} cashed by them on XX/XX/XXXX, which was after the statement was sent, but before the XX/XX/XXXX escrow payment was made. 

In addition, to all the other letters, they sent me a letter stating I had a past due amount of {$64.00}. By the way in the letter they sited my payment had not been received on time for that month, well the post office would disagree. I sent it certified and tracked, and if staff entered it a day or so late that is on them which is why I was n't charged a late fee. ( letter enclosed ). 

I literally have a 3-ring binder full of mail from Ditech, sending me information about foreclosure, sending me to their collection dept., denied me XXXX modification ; however, they will say I rejected them. I have several letters showing they rejected me. They requested the same information over and over, but that was not sufficient. When I applied the 2nd time they rejected me stating it was because I rejected the first one, which is n't true. I also sent a cease and decease letter siting the law that was notarized and they ignored it I pray you can help me resolve this on-going very stressful matter. Ditech is giving me the runaround as a struggling homeowner receiving Social Security XXXX ( since XX/XX/XXXX ), harassing me, sending me to collection, sending me foreclosure mail, and doing their best to confuse everyone, sending out different letter 's with amounts I owe them.

We dont have another 3 weeks for an expedited service ...!!! The buyer signed papers XXXX XXXX but we can not close without the release. We are now facing that my buyer may not be able to go through with the purchase because of the time it has taken to close, we have had to do a lot with the buyers bank they are not patient anymore. This is causing great deals of frustration and stress. Very disappointed that we seem to not be getting anywhere with Beneficial, after all they never did what they where supposed to do 6 years ago and release the lien. They have been dishonest in communication to both myself and escrow officer and have XXXX integrity. I need help to get them to do as they said they would and be able to trust this will be done since this will be the 6th time I have been told its in review. I need resolutions this by this week, or it will cause economic damages to the buyer and to myself.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1959323

This was, and is a jumbo loan. The NationstarModification did not help lower my interest rate, which was 6 %, and still is to this day. I guess the modification was that they allowed a 2 year period as "" interest only '' payments. In XXXX XXXX I began looking into a refinance to lower my rates to a competitive rate. I was quickly advised that my mortgage was listed as "" in Dispute '' by Nationstar. I was also told that Nationstar had reported 5 late payments of more than 90 days. I immediately contacted Nationstar to dispute the late payments, as I pay electronically and have complete records of every payment. They told me they could not tell me the dates, as I was not the correct point of contact for my loan. They told me the law firm that represented my at closing was. I had that firm ( the lawyer contact had left that firm 198 months prior ) to write a letter confirming their dismissal as the point of contact. Along with that letter I included a letter from Nationstar to me advising that the first date of payment would be XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It turns out every reprted late payment was prior to this dateof my first payment. In fact, they applied my XX/XX/XXXX payment to XX/XX/XXXX, even though my firdfirst payment was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Nationstar reports that XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX payments were all late 90 days, even though they advised me in writing that the first payment was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have tried repeatedly to get Nationstar to acknowledge this in writing by email and fax, and I have tried to get them to engage me to modify or re-issue a new or modified loan, because no other lender will touch this because it is my mortgage company who is reporting my incorrect payment history, This raises a huge red flag to anyone willing to help me try to refinance to a competitive rate, and significantly lowers my credit score, both of which make it impossible to refinance. Nationstar has completely avoided dealing with me and will not return my calls. This is just part of my attempt to get them to correct their errors. If I would refinance to a competitive rate my payments would be close to XXXX/month less.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1862055

I have attempted to follow up with XXXX XXXX XXXX on several different occasions with the most recent occurring on XX/XX/XXXX in regards to a statement and itemized bill. The leasing consultant refused and stated that she could not help me.

The collection agency was faxed a copy of all the documents I hade pertaining to the balance but on XX/XX/XXXX they claim they never got them. I was able to retrieve a copy of the fax cover letter and confirmation which clearly states that I indeed sent the information. 
Now the account is in collection and we as the consumer have no way to verify the amount the debt or the accuracy of the balance. We also agreed to pay the balance due once we received a itemized statement with the correct final balance. 
The collection agency, the attorney and the property management have failed to provide us with a final statement. The only thing close to a statement is the letter from the collection agency. 
The charges that should have been removed and are in question include : {$75.00} Return Check Fee {$1000.00} Early Termination Fee {$97.00} Late FeeWe were also to be given a credit of {$330.00} because the apartment was not move in ready but that fee was removed and without being provided a notice.

I spent almost six months in the short sale process. Then, I started pursuing a deed in lieu of foreclosure and it has been one stall after another due to a lien that was released in a timely manner and the remainder due to negligence and lack of due diligence on the part of Wells Fargo. I called in weekly, waited for a month for a document they already had, and they were not honest when I called to check on the status. Weekly being told they were waiting to hear from the title company when the title company was waiting on them. 

My email text today : I called in today to see if the title company accepted the last document I have submitted for the fourth time. Subsequently, I received a call from XXXX ( home preservation specialist supervisor ) stating I called and yelled at whomever I spoke to today which I did not. I had no reason to as I believe she told me all that she could. 

Yes, I am pressing for answers in that I have been trying for months now to complete this deed in lieu of foreclosure process. I have every right to want more specifics given how my file has been mishandled plus I have a time definite to vacate but you all have no time restraints. 

1. Short sale took so long for an approval that the seller backed out. 
2. I am advised of a lien during the deed in lieu process and got it cleared up prior to my XXXX XXXX vacate date. 
3. I have turned in the release four times XXXX, XXXX, ( not advised that the copy was illegible until XXXX ), XXXX, ( then told the title company could not read the upper right hand corner, and submitted it again on XXXX XXXX. I was told by XXXX that my file was being closely monitored and reviewed every two days. 

Today, XXXX, I called to see if the document was accepted by the title company ( XXXX XXXX ). No answers could be provided. So I called XXXX XXXX and they did see where the lien was released and I provided them with both XXXX and XXXX number. This is absurd in that the document is online accessible to anyone and XXXX XXXX has been in business for many years. 

Later, I get a call from XXXX questioning me about my conversation with a Wells Fargo rep who obviously communicated that I was yelling. I had no reason to yell at her. I did not accept yet another vague answer and asked questions for clarification. 

After reflect on my call with XXXX, I am highly offended that my calling for answers is the issue as opposed to processing my file. Please know that I will continue to call every other day. I will continue to voice my dissatisfaction with the mishandling of my file until there is resolution. I no longer trust in what you all say you will do in that you do not stand behind what you say. You asked for an opportunity to resolve. We are still at square one.

I believe my third issue to be the most important, I believe as a direct result of usaa rep XXXX actions of wrongfully ending negotiations XX/XX/XXXX, I 've incurred {$700.00} in additional mo pymts, interest & late fees to date that I SHOULD NOT have incurred. I want this issue resolved immediately by either XXXX or a usaa rep with equivalent or higher authority as XXXX XXXX contacting me directly & agreeing to adjust the final XXXX amount to no less than a minimum of a {$700.00} reduction.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2313558

I immediately applied for a loan modification. I followed through, faxed the application and all necessary documents to One West. Kept in touch with them to make sure they had received them. But every time, there was something missing, or they did n't receive my documents, or the documents had expired because so much time had passed since the first time I had sent the first documents. I felt they were playing me because I knew they had received them. They waited for all that time to go to then tell me, my documents had expired. I have read many similar stories from other homeowners and this bank. I did everything they asked me to and they still took my home, our home. My children and I were devastated whenever they would post our door and finally when they took it from us. This bank had no intention in giving me a modification. We had more than enough time to get it done before the sheriff sale. Finally, just two weeks before the sale, they told me I qualified for the modification but it was too late because the sale date was too close. I could n't believe what I was hearing. This bank has to be punished for what they have been doing to homeowners. It is not like I ignored their phone calls or abandoned my home. I need to help and want to be compensated for my loss. They wanted to take my home because the way they would gain nothing by letting me keep. On the contrary, they would get paid from the FDIC because of the deal they had struck with them.

The burden to conduct the reinvestigation is on the credit reporting agency. It can not be shifted back to the consumer.

Experian continues to deny me my rights by not properly investigation the dispute ( s ). Additionally, Experian continues to deem fraudulent accounts verified when the alleged furnisher has not provided any authenticating documents to substantiate their claim. A credit reporting agency 's reinvestigation obligation is to verify the accuracy of its original source of information. This duty may include going beyond the original source. Whether the credit reporting agency must go beyond the original source depends on a number of factors, including : ( 1 ) whether the consumer has alerted the CRA that the original source may be unreliable ; ( 2 ) whether the CRA itself knows or should know that the original source is unreliable ; and ( 3 ) the comparative costs of verifying the accuracy of the original sources versus the potential harm the inaccurate information may cause the consumer.

Mortgage has been delayed because of mistakes made by this company that should not have been made if they knew what they were doing such as telling me to show a certain amount being withdrawn from a bank acct when in fact it was the wrong amount which caused a 3 week delay because I had to get it changed.

11/8/16,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,LA,708XX,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My husband and our home outright with no mortgage company attached to the title. In XXXX we came across hard times and my husband took out a {$30000.00} loan with a note of approximately {$520.00} a month for 15 years. We always paid our mortgage on time until we came across even harder times in XXXX when our XXXX year old son was XXXX. Our payment on this loan was no more than 2 months behind when I received a phone call from a friend letting us know that our home was in the paper for sale and up for foreclosure. {$520.00} a month paying for 10 years totals {$62000.00} that was paid towards the small {$30000.00} we borrowed against our home which was worth much more than this. Not only did XXXX take our home from us when we were 60 days or so late but they never informed us of any of this and they also sued us for {$26000.00} in XXXX of XXXX plus so called interest, fees and advances. It 's hard to comprehend how after paying {$62000.00} towards a loan of only {$30000.00} that our balance could still be {$26000.00}. That means that of the {$62000.00} paid, less than {$3000.00} went to the principal balance of our mortgage. All of this being said the judgment was filed prior to the house ever going up for sheriff sale which finally took place in XXXX of XXXX and should 've satisfied the unfair judgment rendered against my husband and I. Our mortgage just so happen to be a part of the investigations brought about by the Department of Justice against XXXX XXXX Loans and we were actually written a check because we were part of this law suit. This judgment showing up in public records has prevented me from being able to purchase a home and has cost me {$1000.00} 's in appraisal fees etc. My scores are qualifying but because I am attached to this "" unsatisfied '' judgment because I was on the deed of the property, no title company will approve me. I have tried and tried to contact this company but every number on line gives me a busy signal. Nation Star and XXXX have no records of the loan which is who XXXX sold to. The lawyer that XXXX stated earlier this month that the file was closed in her office, HOWEVER, was not satisfied and because XXXX had not contacted her after the sheriff sale to release the judgment that she could not release it until she heard from them. I asked if the attorney could possibly contact them and she stated she had no way of contacting them because they had gone out of business. I asked what the balance was in order to satisfy the judgment and she could n't give me that either because XXXX had not contacted her. I do n't understand how a judgment is filed prior to sheriff sale, then a sheriff sale takes place, and suddenly the lender disappears and no one has any answers for me about something that is detramental to my life and ever being able to purchase a home again. They have cost me money, time, and their entire loan process was fraudulent from the beginning and still I am the one that suffers and I am left in the dark on what to do next or how to get this taken care of. I 've even had an attorney look into this which cost me another {$500.00} but he too was at a loss because it was impossible to find any contact information for XXXX to get answers. Finally on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I found a number that allowed me to leave a voicemail which I did leave with a lady named XXXX. Not too much later that afternoon someone from XXXX contacted me back. She stated that the judgment should be satisfied and she did n't understand why it was not reflecting that way with the court house. Unfortunately I was at work so I did n't have good service and we ended up getting disconnected before I had a chance to request the release of judgment from her. I thought maybe they would send this to the attorney representing them but as of today they have not and I 've left several more messages and they 've yet to respond again.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2199927

This clear attempt at mis-selling is obviously intended to have me wind up with a product that is n't right for me and more expensive than my current credit facility and whose sole purpose was to generate fees and additional income to the lender with no improvement in my circumstances. What I applied for and was pre-approved for was : Loan Purpose : Refinance No Cashout Loan Amount : {>= $1,000,000} Occupancy type : Primary The contact personnel at XXXX are : XXXX Mortgage Services | Loan Processor XXXX XXXX XXXX | Direct : XXXX and XXXX XXXX Mortgage Services | Centralized Sales | Consultant NMLS # XXXX XXXX ext.

10/1/15,Merchants' Credit Guide Company,IL,606XX,Debt collection,Medical,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Merchants Credit is conducting unfair and perhaps illegal business practices to the detriment of my financial security. For the last few months, I have been working directly and consistently with XXXX XXXX to resolve medical billing issue and Merchants Credit was made aware of this direct relationship. Background : XXXX quoted me just over {$100.00} for a XXXX then billed me nearly {$1500.00} when the procedure was over. After finalizing the bill, I set up a payment arrangement with XXXX for {$50.00} per month for the balance. During these negotiations, I received a letter from Merchants Credit notifying me that they were attempting to collect payment on this debt. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called and spoke with their agent XXXX and informed him that I was and had always been working directly with XXXX. I followed up on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke to supervisor XXXX XXXX. Again, I informed XXXX that I already had a payment plan in place with XXXX, to please contact XXXX regarding the matter, and that I wished not to be contacted regarding the issue because Merchants Credit continued to try and collect this debt that I was already paying. 

Instead of following up with their client, Merchants Credit and XXXX XXXX continued to attempt to collect this debt - one that does n't not belong with their agency and that has always been in good financial standing, never having been a day late - unbeknownst to me. Merchants Credit will not take my word what I am working directly with XXXX XXXX nor will they allow me to provide any evidence verifying the payment plan and the financial status of the account. Furthermore, Merchants Credit has continuously refused to communicate with their client to confirm that this account indeed does not belong with them. 

When I received my credit report XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed these account reporting for the first time ( Merchants Credit is reporting XXXX different accounts that actually fall under XXXX bill and XXXX payment plan ), meaning Merchants Credit had several months to reconcile their records with their client - a simple phone call - but instead chose to report this debt to the three major credit unions - XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This is again, a debt that I do not owe them - I am already paying it directly to XXXX XXXX and they have been aware of that since XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to mediate the issue by offering to call XXXX on a XXXX way call to quickly confirm the payment arrangement - he refused, saying "" he wo n't be on a three way call with anyone '' and "" he does n't do business with them like that. '' XXXX XXXX also threatened that when XXXX XXXX confirms everything I have said is true, Merchants Credit will not take the account off of my credit report, but rather report the balance as being paid in full. This is NOT a satisfactory resolution of the issue because "" paid in full '' reads as though the balance was rightfully in collections, it was n't, and that I paid it off and it will still remain on my credit for the next seven years ( this gives a consumer with an account rightfully in collections no real incentive to pay off the debt because the derogatory account will remain and the "" paid in full '' designation does n't add any major gains to the credit score ). Rather, I would like Merchants Credit to confer with their client ( as they should have and should not be forced to have to do ) OR to allow me to provide proof that the relationship exists and that the money has been consistently paid.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1589244

11/2/16,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,FL,322XX,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"To give you some back ground : I, along with many others, have had my home partially destroyed by Hurricane XXXX. We are in the middle of a disaster. I am making all of my mortgage payments on time while not even living at my house. FEMA flood insurance provides no coverage for living expenses so being out of my house while still having my regular bills is draining my bank account. I would like to have my house fixed as soon as possible. 
Nationstar Mortgage is making the process of getting my house fixed very cumbersome and they are causing everything take longer. 
The first issue : FEMA issued me an advance check to be able to start repairs for {$15000.00} prior to an estimate of total damages. Nationstar is also listed as a payee. I sent the check to them a week ago, paying money I ca n't afford to have 2 day delivery because I desperately need the funds to start repairs. Nationstar is requesting an estimate to endorse the check when there is no estimate yet. Now they are indicating it will be 3 to 5 days more to review all while my family and I are sleeping on couches and repairs are being further held up. Contractors have plenty of work due to the disaster and they will not work without being paid. I still have an equity loan I need to endorse the check as well. 
The second issue : Once the claim goes over 20,000, Nationstar says that they get to hold all of the funds. I do not get to have the money I need to fix my house. This is money that I am receiving from a flood policy that I paid the premium for, not Nationstar. It is not Nationstar 's money. Nationstar says that every estimate, every check, every contractor, it all has to go through them, and they will decide whether to release the funds. This will make the process even longer. At this rate, I will not be back in my house until XXXX. 
Banks should not treat people like this. They are costing my 1000s of dollars by delaying my repairs. We are in the middle of a disaster, and they are showing no flexibility. 
This business practice by Nationstar seems very shady and is having a huge affect on those in need. 
I appreciate any assistance that you can provide. Please feel free to contact me.

The dealer stated that I would have to come in and they would have to "" re-write '' the contract. I retained a lawyer after that. 
In the mean time, I searched for alternative financing and found it with XXXX XXXX XXXX who had no issues what-so-ever with my sources of income. However, they were not able to issue a check to the dealer until the lien Capitol One had placed on the car and been removed.

In the end they said it "" fell through the cracks '' which I find preposterous. 
XXXX financing manger basically told my Attorney "" drop off a check and we 'll release the lien '' ( copies available if needed ) in so many words.

Before I begin I would like to say that the customer service is awful. For one it 's hard to get in touch with someone. Two the times I have spoke with someone other than the supervisor there were attitudes which is unprofessional. I had a slight argument on XXXX separate occasions with someone name XXXX. I believe that 's her name but her attitude needs to improve. The first incident happened when noticed the tone in her voice ( talking to me with an attitude ) which i told her do not get smart with me. The 2nd incident was we were talking about making a payment. She asked me was I 'm ready to make a payment. I told her yes but I have to put the money in my account first. She asked was the money in my account I told her no. I explained to her again that I have to put the money in my account before I make the payment electronically. She then tried to argue me down and try to tell me that I told I her yes when in fact I told her no when she asked me was the money in my account. From that point on I decide that I will directly with the supervisor. 

After missing XXXX and XXXX payments due to financial hardship I was told by XXXX that the foreclosure process would begin if I did n't have both XXXX and XXXX payments by XXXX XXXX. When I made XXXX payment I dealt with XXXX the supervisor. He was helpful as far as holding off from signing off on the foreclosure and giving me extra time to make the payment. I explained to him that I began doing real estate wholesaling and that I was closing on XXXX of my deals which I 'm still waiting to get paid til this day due to constant delays. 

What I realize now is 2 things. 1st is when I was told by XXXX that they will foreclosed on my home after missing XXXX and XXXX payments. She quickly mentioned that to me but did n't bother to tell me about different programs they have to offer in order to help me prevent foreclosure. I spoke with XXXX multiple times throughout the process and he never told me what other programs they have to offer either but he 's the supervisor. According to my research, mortgage companies are suppose to tell the mortgagor what other options they have to prevent foreclosure which State Home Mortgage failed to do. With me being a first time home buyer, different should have been explained to me. 

2nd is I received a letter from SHM on XXXX XXXX regarding my loan being approved for foreclosure. The kicker is that the letter was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 which I thought was ridiculous. It says that my loan was scheduled to be referred to a foreclosure attorney on the morning of XXXX XXXX even though I received the letter on XXXX XXXX. The letter shows on the XXXX page what options are available to prevent foreclosure but it was already too because I receive the letter after the fact. Way to go and thanks a lot. It 's crazy that I received this at the time that I did receive it. I called the supervisor XXXX and left him a message and heard from him the following week. 

I feel that letter could have been sent to me at least 30 days in advanced because I 'm pretty sure some of the options available will take a while before a final decision is made. I did n't get the at least 7 days prior. 

Those are my issues with this company. Now I see why there 's been a lot of bad reviews and lawsuits.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2236014

I was surprised for OCWEN to tell me that I still needed to pay for the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX when I followed up the status of my modification in XX/XX/XXXX because I have not received any papers from them yet. I asked them for the transcripts of all my telephone conversations with them that occured in the month of XX/XX/XXXX to prove to them that I was told not to pay while the HAMP application is still in review but they declined to provide me the full transcript and I was told that I needed to pay for the months of XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX which I declined to do so pending my request 's fulfillment which is the telephone transcripts for the month of XXXX.

Because I am twice widowed and have no financial help, my credit has been dinged during this recession and need some help with moving because my job offer is a XXXX drive one way from my home. 
Of course the first guy I talked to strung me a lot to believe it would not be a problem, so that he could get an application and run a credit check on me to save his own job, which of course then pulls my score down even further and keeps me from getting any help from anyone, then he turns me down saying it is due to past due payments. Is that not want I told him I called to get a loan for and fix to begin with? The amount for the refinance was within his limits for my vehicle, but still turned me down for the payments being late on it, which I told him was why I called to get the loan. Why would he run a credit bureau on me and further damage my score? I then asked to talk to a loan XXXX because he had no answers for any of my questions. She was just as bad or worse, had no compassion, rude and disrespectful, when I asked her what other ideas she could give me in my situation, she said none, she did not know, said they do n't give credit counseling. 
Both of them were so incompetent. I then decided, based on this experience to close my savings account with them, which only has XXXX dollars in it and if they could not help me with such a small issue as what I brought to them, do not need them in the future and account being open is not helping me in anyway, only them to help them meet their quotas. I then called back and spoke with XXXX and she was just as rude. I told her I wanted to shut the savings account down, which is the only account I have with them. 
She said she sent a message to the department that closing them to do so but they may be gone for the day and she said she would mail me a check for my XXXX dollars. It was after XX/XX/XXXX, but not closing time. I asked her to give me a time frame of when it would be closed. She then put me on hold and said she would take care of it. She came back and said it had been closed. Then I get up this morning and there are XXXX different emails in my email account from them confirming my request to stop online delivery of statements, which I never did, and claiming they would have to charge me a dollar per statement going forward on all my account unless I have a checking with XXXX balance. Then another email about my credit card statement when I do n't and never have had a credit card with them. 
They are simply trying to find some way to illegally hold onto my measly XXXX dollars. Note I never emailed or contacted them to request anything, so have no idea why they sent all of these emails. I only requested by phone yesterday XX/XX/XXXX that they close my savings account and send me the balance of what is in the account by mail. I have worked for several banks in the past and left them for this and other reasons, Pentagon Federal is just like them. I want to get away from banks and credit unions completely and would encourage all to do so. They are greedy and intentionally incompetent and the same kind of people work in all of them, the kind of people I do n't want anything to do with.

They have inquiries on my credit that do not belong to me, nor can they prove that they belong to me. According to that alone, I have grounds for my lawsuit. I have attached what I have sent them in the mail. I am sure they have received notification of my lawsuit. Instead of having to pay me, all they have to do is remove the incorrect items off of my report. They have n't and it seems that they do n't intend to. It is illegal to deny me a proper investigation. None of the supposed creditors have provided any proof nor responded. Meaning the items should be removed off. Not to mention that TransUnion reinserted XXXX XXXX XXXX onto my report after removing it last year and that is illegal. I have proof of that as well that i will be attaching to this email. TransUnion is in Hot water. TransUnion removed XXXX XXXX XXXX from my report on XXXX/XXXX/2016. They added it back on there and then removed it again on XXXX/XXXX/2016.

Savings to checking and vice versa is essentially real-time. When making transfers from XXXX to a credit card, it is not real-time. WHY?! I made a {$500.00} transfer on a Friday from savings to my credit card. The funds were immediately withdrawn from the savings but not posted to the credit card. How can some transfers be real-time and others not in the same system. It seems to me that for credit cards transfers that this "" Delayed posting '' is a selected specific system setting. I have memberships at several other credit unions ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX and all of those XXXX are significantly smaller in asset size than Navy Fed and they ALL allow real-time posting on ALL products. My complaint is that when Navy does this, funds are removed from my savings account where I begin losing interest immediately yet the post is delayed to the credit card where I am still being charged interest on my balance! If the funds are removed from my savings and not posted to another product, where are they? They seems to be in a "" virtual '' status where Navy is not paying interest on those funds and still charging interest on the other account balance. If much smaller institutions have real-time transfers then the largest credit union in the world should as well especially if they have this on other products. If they are doing this to me then what are they essentially earning on those virtual funds when this happens to possibly XXXX of members monthly! When this delay occurs on a long holiday weekend, which becomes a delay from Friday night until the funds are finally posted to the credit card during their "" end-of-day '' processing on Tuesday! In short, that is a ton of interest that members are losing and Navy is earning.

Regardless of "" type '' of loan. The document says they were discharged. It does not specify that the loans were student or not, but a minor disclaimer is all that is included. It is beyond unclear, and this is reaching a territory that is creating a very difficult situation. I am thinking of never working again because of the legal process in place. 
This uneven and unequal economy progress has left me without a decent job, and has made it difficult to find any faith and trust in repayment of the studies that I am coming to realize are for me to act as a slave to your economic engine. 
I am becoming quickly an enemy of the state and am now looking into which nations I can go to and claim financial burden as a reason to seek asylum. It will end the dynamic relationship of my family moving to this country over the years, but at this point the unrealistic expectations set by federal policy and not protecting citizens has essentially established a poor state, and this is violating my constitutional right. 
I need assistance, support in clarification and I am demanding the support needed to redefine the rule under which student loans are managed. 
Discharge should be available just like every consumer loan. Student loans do n't always pay tuition. In my case my debts paid for my housing, my food, and other related expenses while I was studying. They are more like consumer loans and they should be discharged as such, but due to the excessive cost, confusion, and the downright cruel and unusual punishment based on the lack of access to the necessary body I am finding that I hate my government and under my own constitutional right will sign for any and all access to foreign government agencies to government and protect me under their rule of law vanquishing the territorial control of the US, it 's leaders and the constitution that is governing this, thus establishing unjust policy. 

I lost my job in XXXX, I have been dealing with XXXX, and am at a point that I have no faith and trust in the workplace, and in the US Dollar. I am at a point that I declared bankruptcy because I felt overwhelmed and incapable of repayment. As student loan debt is permanent, I have grown frustrated further and have given up on furthering my education, and am not going to work anymore because it is a taxation on me through interest that is paying a public loan servicer. This is a huge violation of the constitution and I do not care what punishment is part of it. The politicians and banks are in collusion against the taxpayers. Thus, I am not paying back anything now. I will declare a civil war before I do. Thus, I will be XXXX, and will request international guidance and their involvement to restrain the XXXX Government against genocide of those seeking to elevate their knowledge to build a better life and that the Republicans and rich sought to destroy the potential growth of the economy through usury.

EMC stated in my XXXX court case that they never had interest in my property and were never a beneficiary. XXXX XXXX was with XXXX XXXX when this was admitted. It was also admitted by XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were legal counsel for XXXX XXXX. It was also admitted by XXXX XXXX, EMCs attorney. XXXX XXXX, general counsel for EMC and JP Morgan wrote an affidavit as well that she was not able to find this loan/property anywhere. XXXX XXXX said they did an extensive search. A new lawsuit has now been filed. This time it is judicial and XXXX XXXX is at it again. They represent the sole XXXX, XXXX XXXX, but under the guise of XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is their client. Anyways, they had a XXXX witness come into court ( who failed to mention she had a XXXX degree from XXXX University and had practiced law in Oregon ). Anyways, she made some interesting statements and due to her education level should most definitely be held more accountable for her testimony. The XXXX assignment made by WF on my property ( recorded in public realm XX/XX/XXXX ) was admitted as inaccurate by XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( I sent you a copy of his declaration and the verbatim previously ). After admittance, nobody exercised due diligence and removed the XX/XX/XXXX assignment from public record, despite XXXX XXXX 's and EMCs own admittance that it was inaccurately recorded in the public realm and that EMC has never had interest nor a beneficiary of my property. INSTEAD they left it there to build off of it, therefore rendering every single other assignment made in XX/XX/XXXX void. They show a XX/XX/XXXX assignment from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and then an XX/XX/XXXX assignment to EMC LLC as their attorney in fact to XXXX XXXX. They also altered XXXX of the endorsements. Funny, the XXXX XXXX XXXX trust requires that the note and DOT be endorsed properly. The note is absent an XXXX endorsement. XXXX XXXX admitted that the endorsement on the note to XXXX was added XX/XX/XXXX. The trust has a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. There is no way this loan was effectively sold into the XXXX XXXX XXXX trust. Matter of fact, XXXX XXXX states they are the custodian and they have documents in their custodian file that state ENDORSMENT ISSUE ( ATTORNEY NEEDS ) and also another document that states UNPOOLED. They claim it is in the XXXX pool of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX would need to be a ncessary party if this loan was truly put into the trust, as well as timely I might add, per the specific rules of the XXXX agt. My mortgage note was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX bankruptcy, and the loan was not re-affirmed. XXXX XXXX had a non-negotiable instrument. However, I paid approx. $ XXXX in payments direct to XXXX XXXX in good faith, despite no longer being an obligor on the note, and since I had not paid off the loan. IN GOOD FAITH. XXXX XXXX tried to get me to sign a loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX that had ridiculous errors that they tried to pass off as a computer glitch. They raised the interest rate which raised the payment, all during our hardship. XXXX XXXX said had we signed the loan modification, EMC would have honored it. This statement alone ( although hearsay, but it was said ), tells me the loan could not possibly be in the trust for starters. XXXX XXXX 's witness XXXX XXXX claimed that XXXX has held the note and DOT the entire time, which is another reason why I do not believe the loan was put into the trust. I am not sure how XXXX XXXX could have LEGALLY negotiated a note that was no longer a negotiable instrument due to it being discharged in chapter XXXX BK in XX/XX/XXXX and not being re-affirmed.

I started working with them on a modification and this is where things escalated. I filled out the forms and faxed them back to the company. I made XXXX mistake this I own up to I forgot to write in the name of the mortgage company. It was faxed back with this information filled in.I had the confirmation on this fax and the one prior to it. 
I called back a few weeks later and they informed me that the paystubs did n't have a year to date on them and they did. I do n't get a normal paystub they are emailed to me. all information was on these stubs and spoke representatives a few times. being told that it was n't a problem. I called back again and this time I was informed that they were no good that they did n't contain a year to date portion. I faxed them back and circled the information that it was.

I had to wait to get to a terminal where I could have them printed out differently. Faxed those back and called to see if they went thru. first time they did not. faxed them yet again on a later date. waited and called back. This time they had. 
XXXX its not easy to get a confirmation. There was also a time that during this time period the rep I was dealing with called me. I had asked her to call me back in 10 minutes, she did n't. 
I called again to see how things were going with the progress of the modification and was then informed that the paper work had expired.

In a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, PNC recanted that the property is eligble for PMI removal. In XXXX XXXX, I contacted PNC as follow-up to their XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter. In response, by letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, PNC stated "" The HOPA of XXXX does not allow automatic termination of PMI for a second home or an investment property. ' 'Therefore, we are required to follow the deletion requirements of the loan vestor. '' In the letter PNC Mortgage is also requesting an appraisal at my expense. I also received separate correspondence of the same date, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, with another Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. In this ( adjustment ) statement, PNC Mortgage indicates an escrow shortage of {$760.00} and an increase in monthly mortgage payment from {$560.00} to {$680.00} XXXX XXXX ). I have NEVER made any money on this property while renting ; have always had to supplement the monthly payment. It is my opinion that PNC Mortgage is being quite absurd about their inconsistent business practices. In the past, they have also overcharged for Flood Insurance on the property ( as has XXXX XXXX ) and also placed flood insurance on the property at the same time XXXX XXXX had provided coverage. * I am not able to scan to upload my supporting documentation, will need permission to fax or mailing instructions. My request is that PNC Mortgage be required to reimburse me for the duplicate and excessive flood premiums charged and also they further explain why their Escrow Analysis have been inconsistent over the past 14 years.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1370239

They also charged me a {$46.00} late charges and a {$20.00} fee that they claimed was "" overdue ''. How can there be late charges when the payment due XXXX/XXXX/15 was received by them on XX/XX/XXXX? 
I refinanced my house on XX/XX/2015 with XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2015 they prepared a Payoff Statement showing an outstanding principle of {$130000.00} yet the statement dated XX/XX/XXXX showed an outstanding balance of {$130000.00}. Why the XXXX differenced for balances good until XX/XX/XXXX? As I mentioned above, they received my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX that cleared my bank on the same day. Obviously this payment was not included in the payoff amount dated XX/XX/2015 which noted that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was still due. I was told by both XXXX XXXX and the title company who did my closing that I would be refunded for this double payment. But when I called today I was told there was no credit on my account and I had to write their research department and request the refund before it would be sent! That is simply not right. I did receive a {$3500.00} refund of my escrow account, which to be fair only showed {$3400.00} on the XX/XX/XXXX statement. But where do they come up with these numbers ; should n't they match? 
My entire association with Carrington has been frustrating at best. When they first took over my account I tried to enroll in auto payments as I had my savings account set up to cover the payments with payroll deductions. This worked with the other XXXX mortgage companies that serviced my account, but not with Carrington! Apparently XXXX has a different routing number for my savings account and wrote them saying it needed updated. Rather than correcting it like the others did, they froze my account and prevented me from making any payments either online or over the phone. No matter how many phone calls I made to try and fix this, nothing was ever accomplished. They even shut down my access to my online account. They seemed to be doing everything they could to prevent me from making a timely payment. One time I was on the phone with their representative trying to make my payment from another bank account and I gave her the routing and account number directly from the check ; she even repeated the account information to make sure everything was right but nothing ever processed. However, they were quick to access a late payment fee. No wonder the "" XXXX '' website is full of similar complaints. Should n't some agency be investigating them? How can a company that has the ability to destroy people 's lives not have to maintain standards and accountability? 
Even when I got the XXXX involved earlier this year, their representative was curt and totally unhelpful. I remember that she was able to spend what must have been hours researching my calls to Carrington ; but could n't spend a couple of minutes helping me out. Apparently their motto is "" XXXX them before you help them ''. 
Anyway, I 'm thankful to be working with XXXX XXXX now, a company with a solid reputation for taking care of their customers and this whole ordeal is almost behind me. So please, consumer protection agents, help me obtain my rightful refund from these scoundrels so I can have them forever in my past. Hopefully this letter and the attached statements will provide you with enough information to warrant further investigation. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1659709

12/15/15,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,GA,301XX,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,Using a debit or ATM card,,"XXXX : The following is the over view of my issue with AMEX debit cards. This issue has occurred nearly a dozen times. The issue is AMEX making an error in processing a payment/ return. The amount of time to have wrongly removed monies from the account runs nearly 8 business days which is nearly 2 weeks of a consumer not having access to their own money. Although VP 's contacted me, the error was not corrected. 

I am contacting you concerning the recent scandal involving the XXXX XXXX. Due to a similar issue with AMEX, I will be addressing the issue in the same manner as I and my partners addressed the issue below concerning XXXX. The case is now part of the XXXX case to break up XXXX and fine the corporation {$6.00} XXXX http : XXXX. 

We are taking the XXXX approach to addressing the massive and industry wide scam of stealing from consumers and inconveniencing them in a very harmful way. For example AMEX and most of these cards encourage the working class and poor to have Social Security, XXXX, their paychecks, etc. directly deposited to debit cards. As in the XXXX XXXX situation those funds are made unavailable through errors, and other unethical practices to increase revenue for the card companies. We will be calling on the federal and state governments to take action that bars swipe fees, any wait time for consumers to have access to their monies due to error or profit gouging by card companies. The movement will involve reaching the public and legislators through press releases, press conferences, taking legal action, and boycotting companies that are in the consumer exploitation business. 

If your organization would like to participate please let me know how we can help.

I received the XXXX For tax year XXXX, wherein I had to include it in my tax return and incurred tax consequences. The continued reporting of a past due balance on my credit report is highly damaging to my ability to obtain favorable finance terms and is putting my family in a position where we are unable to secure housing due to this.

This is a huge problem. Numerous correction attempts with the credit bureaus and GM Financial have yielded no results. 

I have done research on the topic and would like to advise both the CFPB and GM FINANCIAL that this issue has been litigated extensively, and that it has been decided numerous times by courts that it is inequitable to allow a creditor to belatedly enforce a debt after it received the tax benefit of the Charge-off, in addition to it being inequitable to require me to report this cancelled DEBT as income on my federal tax return and face tax consequences and STILL hold me liable on the debt.

2/19/16,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CT,060XX,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I have a mortgage equity loan with Bank of America on a home I 've owned since XX/XX/XXXX. There has been an unexplained fee on my account since XX/XX/XXXX, when I avoided losing my home to the bank through my state 's mortgage mediation program. Although the bank representative assigned to my loan at the time never returned any of my calls, I 've kept paying on the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I finally wrote the bank requesting an explanation and itemization of all the fees I 've been charged and all the payments I 've made. However, the bank never responded to my letter. 
I thought that by putting my request in writing, the bank would explain what the questionable fee is ; it does n't seem to be based on the loan 's interest rates or principle. I also wanted to know if my payment records coincided with the bank 's records, which the statements do n't seem to show. My monthly payments currently are only on the loan 's interest and just slightly above the minimum rate. However, I do n't know how the bank is applying my monthly payments to the loan, the principle of which is substantial. The interest rates on this equity loan are relatively low, but my payments do n't seem to be reducing this portion of the debt. 
The fee in question used to average about {$1200.00} on each statement. However, my XXXX XXXX statement shows a {$310.00} increase over last month 's fee ; the fee rose from {$1200.00} in XXXX XXXX to {$1500.00}. My XXXX XXXX statement shows that the fee now is up to {$1800.00}. With these sudden {$300.00} increases a month, I will soon owe the bank thousands of dollars on an unexplained fee that I ca n't afford to pay. 
Also, each of my mortgage statements now includes a notice that the bank has not received the previous month 's payment. Each monthly payment has posted to my checking account ; therefore, the bank is receiving and accepting my money. 
A generic message on the statement now threatens to notify the credit bureaus of delinquent payments. By the bank claiming that it 's not receiving previous monthly payments, it can report this false information to the credit bureaus and eventually foreclose on my home again. 
I am requesting the following information : 1. What the unexplained fee is for 2. Why the unexplained fee is now rising significantly each month 3. Why the bank claims on each of my statements that it has n't received the previous month 's payment 4. Whether the bank is applying my monthly payments to the loan I will provide any additional information needed to help resolve this issue. A fair solution would be for the bank to answer the questions outlined above and to waive the unexplained fee. 
I have attached a copy of the following : 1. XXXX XXXX statement 2. XXXX XXXX statement 3.

The following day I received another call and I informed them that the payment had been sent and that they should contact the mortgage link to resolve the matter. On XXXX XXXX I made a three-way call with XXXX and Plaza Home Mortgage. We were assisted by a lady name XXXX and she informed them that the check had been endorsed over to Plaza home mortgage and sent to their XXXX PA office. She then emailed copies of the front and back of the check and the endorsement and all information associated with the transfer to Plaza home mortgage. The gentleman on the phone noted that some of the information Plaza had provided to XXXX was incorrect. He then stated that he would work to find the check.

I asked the person on the phone if they had no information regarding the dispute about whether the had been made. She also demanded copies of the front and back of the check I told her that dissenter already been sent she then ignored that and continued to demand payment. When it became obvious that Plaza home mortgage would do nothing to resolve the matter but demand payment I decided it was time to seek legal advice. 

Before doing so I made one last ditch effort to resolve the matter I found a lady on their website who seem to be somewhat helpful she took my information and two days later I received a call from her stating that she could not find the check and that I should resend the check and put a stop payment on the previous check. All in the meantime I continue to receive threatening phone calls and letters from loss mitigation regarding foreclosure from Plaza home mortgage. 

The people at Plaza seem to have no understanding of what it was was going on or they did not care. They only seem to want a second payment which they did not deserve, they made no attempt to resolve the situation they only seem to want more money. They were very unprofessional and unethical. They called on numerous occasions while I was at work in an attempt to embarrass me.

I could not find the number so I XXXX it. When I called the number a XXXX XXXX answered the phone and asked me was I calling about my student loans. He may have said are you calling to consolidate your student loans. I told him I was calling to request a deferment on my student loans. He went through the spill of telling me about the federal government forgiveness program. I had heard of it but never checked into it nor read about it. What he told me I took for truth and he told me that the federal government was offering the loan forgiveness program if you qualify. He asked me a few questions and determined I qualified. He told me it would cost {$390.00} and XXXX $ a month for 20 years afterwards the balance forgiven. I told him I had to think about. Up until now I thought I was talking with representative from Navient ; he then told me to think about and gave me the correct number to call Navient. I did not mention this to Navient when I called ; I only ask for the deferment information. After a few weeks I decided to call XXXX XXXX back, thinking he is with the XXXX to start the process of loan forgiveness. Unfortunately after I paid the {$390.00} to XXXX XXXX and was not able to get back in touch with him the next day I felt uneasy. I paid this money on a Thursday, Monday I called Navient to tell them what happen. They inform me that I had talked with a third party company. The company XXXX XXXX is with is called FedLoan Help Center. Navient informed me that they were playing off the name XXXX XXXX with is a legit company they deal with for consolidation and loan forgiveness and is a free service. I have called and emailed XXXX XXXX, no response. I will continue to call the XXXX XXXX XXXX to request a refund, but I have signed papers electronically and I am not sure how far I will get or how long this will take. I am furious that he had mislead me to believe he was with the XXXX and that the Federal Government was offering loan forgiveness for XXXX $ and XXXX $ a month for 20 years and then I would be forgiven for the balance.

Now, Kohl 's refuses to act on my request to send me copies of the fraudulent documentation used in opening that account ; instead, Kohl 's states that such information will be provided only to a law enforcement agency, at the request of said agency. As I read Title 15 U.S. Code Chapter 41 Subchapter III Section 1681g, the victim himself is entitled to copies of the fraudulent documentation but must make the request for it in writing and must meet other reasonable requirements that can be imposed by the business which granted the credit. It is my understanding that providing the information to a law enforcement agency is contemplated in XXXX scenarios : ( 1 ) where the victim 's written request specifies which agency is to receive the documentation ; or, ( 2 ) where there happens to be a law enforcement agency investigating the ID theft and that agency is authorized by the victim to take the relevant records. I do not see how these provisions can be interpreted by the credit-granting business to deny the victim 's request to be given the fraudulent documentation directly. In my case, I have sent Kohl 's written requests to have the information sent to me. Accordingly, scenario ( 1 ) above does not apply. Also, as there is no law enforcement agency investigating my ID theft, notwithstanding reports filed at XXXX separate police departments, scenario ( 2 ) above does not apply. In summary, I believe that Kohl 's misunderstands the right of the victim of ID theft to receive directly, and not via a law enforcement agency, copies of the fraudulent documentation and is unreasonably attempting to require me to trouble one or another law enforcement agency to obtain copies of the fraudulent documentation on my behalf.",,Older American,Web,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1866470

My personal information is being floated in what is known in the debt collection business as a "" Debt Pool '', whereas collection information is outdated and not even enforceable. The attached collection from Midwest Recovery Systems does not state that the debt is no longer enforceable, a stipulation by the Federal Trade Commission. The method of an illegal posting of a collection on my personal credit report, or an illegal collection against my rights of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can not be tolerated. In Federal Trade Commission v. XXXX ( XX/XX/2009 ) the federal district court decided in favor of the Federal Trade Commission that a collection agency must operate within strict guidelines in the collection of a debt. The criteria are as follows : 1 ) The debt must still be enforceable within the state of procurement or where the original obligator resides, or a combination of both. 
2 ) The debt collector must be licensed and bonded if applicable within the state in which it is trying to collect, if the debt is collectable. 
3 ) The validation of debt ownership must be proved, without exception. 
There is no statement on the attached collection that the debt is no longer enforceable. The collection agency stipulates that XXXX obtained a judgment against me. By legal mandate, the docket number of the judgment must be listed as well as what county clerk 's office the judgment is filed with. In this case, there is no judgment. The statement saying "" This judgment may be forwarded to an attorney for execution '' is a complete falsehood. There can not be a lawsuit as the legal time limit to enforce a summary judgment action has passed. 
Even though the collection letter states that illegal, abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collections are illegal, this collection in its entirety is just that, a deceptive illegal attempt to collect a debt that is no longer enforceable. 
I demand that all my information be purged immediately by Midwest Recovery Systems and XXXX, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take the necessary steps to sanction both companies for using such abusive collection tactics.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2426542

I claim that the trade line payment history has been cut off purposely for the direct intentions of re-aging the deadline as to when the account should be removed. The creditor shows that the drop dead removal deadline is XXXX XXXX on all bureaus, but the fact remains that I was late on my very first payment in XXXX XXXX. Accordingly, the drop dead date for the removal of this trade line should be XXXX XXXX. I was making payments that were at least 30 days from the very beginning of the account opening. The 7-year rule of the Fair Credit Reporting Act applies and the financial institution has no other recourse but to remove the trade lime immediately and permanently. The timeline to file a lawsuit to collect has expired based upon the rules on the state of New York. The following case research rules in my favor on the illegal usage of re-aging debt timelines : ITEMS HAVE BEEN RE-AGED EXTENDING NEGATIVE HISTORY BEYOND 7-YEAR TIMELINE SEVEN/TEN YEAR RULE UNDER FCRA GUIDELINES - REMOVAL OF TRADE LINES Experian, XXXX and XXXX Are Aware Of Timeline Extensions by Creditors Case in point, if a credit card payment was late 84 months ago, and since that time period the credit card was paid in full, settled for less than full balance, or charged off by a federally insured bank as mandated under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Rule 5000, applicability of applying a charge off standard to debt service, then the creditor must report the true payment history on the credit trade line for a minimum of 84-months. The Federal Trade Commission has levied fines and penalties against creditors for using a re-aging process totally in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines. Re-aging of debts have been used by the Internal Revenue Service by re-issuing federal tax liens with a new fining number when the 10-year rule timeline was running out. It is used by creditors as a means of stalling or delaying one 's credit rating, simply by cutting off several years of previous payment histories. This process is highly illegal and abusive to the integrity of the credit reporting system that was designed to be fair and accurate for the commercial banking industry to extend to those that qualify to pay a specific debt back to the issuing financial institution. It was not designed for manipulation by creditors to extend the worthiness of a debt or the fair timeline to report a debt payment history. I request as part of the credit bureau reinvestigation a summary of my payment history, not copies of any statements, from the listed creditor to prove the true and accurate timeline as to when a credit item should be removed. A SPECIFIED DATE OF WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS TO BE REMOVED IS MANDATORY!!! Any attempt from a creditor or the Internal Revenue Service to extend a debt timeline will, upon failure to remove an extended item, be reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against the credit reporting agency not complying with a full re-investigative process.

12/1/16,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,110XX,Credit card,,Billing statement,,"I believe my credit card company, Chase Visa, is deliberately pursuing policies designed to incur financial charges. 

My credit card statement was lost in the mail so I called for a replacement. The process to procure a replacement statement is unfair to consumers and circumvents what I understand to be the law. 

Unlike others, the company does NOT email you a replacement statement. There are 3 options : 1. ) create an online account and log in to get a statement ; 2. ) have a statement mailed to you which will take "" 10-14 days '' to arrive ; 3. ) have a statement faxed to you "" within one hour ''. 

To create an online account, I am forced to sign a complete and full agreement I do not want to sign. I do not want to create an online account which will be used by Chase in other ways rather than simply the one-off use of obtaining a missing statement. 

The option to have a replacement mailed is absurd. This almost guarantees that finance charges will start accruing before the statement arrives. 

I chose to receive a fax. Despite the one hour service delivery promise, I had to call 5 times in a day to receive a fax and finally received it overnight ( this is noted on my account ). When the fax finally arrived, it was missing information because ( I was advised ) the statement pages are too long and not designed to be faxed. I had the statement faxed to me 3 times to verify this ; each fax was missing the same information. ( I have included copies of these faxes ) This is NOT a problem with my machine which operates perfectly normally and the Chase supervisor told me this was to do with the page size of the statement, which is not compatible with faxing. My call was recorded so this conversation can be listened to Because Chase uses regular postal service for mailing its statements, there must be tens of thousands of statements which are lost every year, simply in the normal course of business. The process for a consumer to obtain a replacement is ill-designed and does not include reasonable steps to get a bill to a customer in a timely fashion, which is required by law. The Chase process circumvents the law by putting the consumer in the unfair position of, in order to avoid finance charges, paying a bill before a detailed statement is received. 

I wish to make a second complaint against Chase. I wanted to complain about this process to whoever regulates Chase ( there are so many agencies I was unsure of the correct one ). The Chase rep, XXXX, whom I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX, told me she was not allowed to provide me with this information. I asked her to note this in my account. I was transferred to a supervisor. She told me she did not have this information and advised me to look it up online. I want to complain that Chase employees are not equipped to provide consumers even with simple information about their rights, like who Chase is regulated by.

After I received the money I submit a complaint through Money Grams web site, asking why they were charging me for dividing the payment, they answered me that the difference of the values was not for an extra charge but it was because they used the exchange rate of the day that was divided the payment which is under the rate when I delivered the money. 
The complaint is under case number XXXX since XXXX XXXX, Money Gram asked me some detailed information about which offices and agents I visited. I have asked about updates for this case number and they have answered me that the investigation is still under process, but after almost two months I am noticing no progress at all. 
From my point of view I have been a victim of the lack of communication between Money Gram with their agents and customers therefore I should receive the amount of money initially agreed, when I delivered the money.

8/9/16,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IA,522XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"This is a follow-up to Case number : XXXX. I disputed the resolution to that case and am resubmitting the case with additional evidence supporting my position. 

Here is a summary of the description from the prior case : I applied for a Citigold Checking account with Citibank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after receiving the promotion code XXXX. The requirements for this promotion were to open a Citigold checking account, make one bill pay transaction for two consecutive months, and make {$1000.00} in purchases via the debit card. Upon completion of the promotion requirements, I would receive XXXX AAdvantage Miles. Citibank opened my Citigold Checking Acct in early XXXX XXXX. I promptly deposited funds and began working to satisfy the promotion requirements. I completed the bill payments on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I completed the {$1000.00} in debit card purchases on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Following completion of the requirements, I contacted Citibank customer services and was informed that I had met the requirements and the miles would be post XXXX statements after the period in which I met the requirements. Given the requirements were completed in XX/XX/XXXX and the XX/XX/XXXX statement closed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I expect the miles to post XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. After not receiving the XXXX AAdvantage miles by XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message to Citibank via the messaging function on their website on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. After several weeks I received a letter from Citibank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX indicating that after investigation they determined that I was not actually eligible for the promotion. This contradicts information previously provided to me by Citibank customer service. 

Citi response ( summary ) : In our review we found that the offer in question, promotional code XXXX, was not directed to you. Upon review of your interaction with our Citibank representatives via chat, phone, and online message, we found no evidence of misinformation. Please be advised that although you may choose to enter any given promotion code during the online application process, the promotion eligibility itself is still subject to verification. For this reason we must respectfully decline your request for the XXXX AAdvantage miles promotion. 
If you would like us to research this matter further, please provide us with documentation showing you were solicited for the promotion. We thank you for the opportunity to respond to your concerns and look forward to serving you in the future. 

Based on Citi 's response for additional information, I do not understand how Citibank can deny my request by indicating that the promotion code XXXX was not directed to me. I am attaching the Promotional Disclosure that I printed upon submission of the application for the Citigold checking account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The first sentence of the Terms and Conditions section of the Disclosure clearly states that promotional offer was attached to my account ( i.e. "" This offer is available to Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmembers who receive this communication ). I have been a Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmember since XX/XX/XXXX. Included in the attached image is a copy of the my Citi AAdvantage credit card. In addition to receiving the XXXX AAdvantage miles due to me, I am also requesting that Citibank remove the past 3 monthly account fees charged to my Citigold checking account ( $ XXXX/month = {$90.00} total ) to compensate for my inconvenience of having to repeatedly follow-up with Citi regarding this offer.

5/13/16,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",SC,297XX,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"In XXXX I was diagnosed with XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX I lost my ability to work. That meant we lost half our income. We had a mortgage with Countrywide which was purchased by Bank of America. I called Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX while we were still current with our mortgage and told them of my health issue and we were concerned we might not be able to make our payments in a few months. We were looking ahead and trying to make a plan. We were told they could n't help us because we were current. By the end of the year we were not. When we were contacted about late fees I called again and we were told we could have 3 months without making payments. When I called back to see how to make our payments we were told nothing. I could n't reach anyone to discuss this with. I was given a phone number to call but no one ever spoke with me or returned my calls. Months passed and we kept getting monthly mortgage statements showing we were more and more in debt with them. There was no 3 month hiatus from payments. I called everyday and got the same treatment. I finally made a complaint to consumer protection and soon we got a response from Bank of America and we were in forclosure. I did receive another message from Consumer Protection to send more information which I did. This is now over a period of 2-3 years and we finally were offered a modification from XXXX XXXX which we had to take. This modification would have been fine except it includes a balloon payment at some point in time to Bank of America for {$110000.00}. We have tried to get a HARP loan but the loan repayment we make does n't finance or pay down that money to Bank of Anerica. 
In the end Bank of America said we missed one of our modification payments to them. As we have spent years trying to sort this out it appears that one of those 3 modification payments was made in error. My husband wrote the check for {$1300.00} instead of {$1300.00}. But we never heard about that until we contacted consumer protection. 
Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX and every year we have gotten deeper in debt. We 've tried again for a HARP loan but the issue is still the same. Our mortgage is being paid with that balloon that will pop some day. We get deeper in debt and they get off the hook ( well not completely ) but with us they did. 
This year I hope I can finally start working again if I can get a XXXX position to do case management from home. But I am being XXXX it seems. I have n't worked for 6 years and for 4 years I 've received XXXX. So I will be retired. I tried to get help from XXXX but I 'm XXXX soon to be XXXX. I thought I could work until XXXX? I guess not if you get XXXX. Almost 7 years and XXXX XXXX, XXXX therapy and to XXXX and back later I feel like I could work. My husband is 17 years younger and I want to help pay for all the financial mess we have before I 'm gone or ca n't do much of anything. We 've borrowed against his retirement to pay off debt only to get even deeper in debt. We have n't even paid off my mothers funeral bill and she died two years ago. But we pull up our grown up pants and keep trying. 
I do n't want to leave this life owing Bank of America {$110000.00} and leaving my husband to deal with it. I want them to refund that amount to us because they cheated at the game. They lied and hid and would n't come to the phone or put their big boy/girl pants on. 
I hope you can help me keep teaching them they still are n't off the hook. We deserve to be treated as the responsible hard working tough Americans that we are.

The mortgage was refinanced and I was not aware that the bank account would incur fees in the amount of {$25.00} at that point. I called to explain the misunderstanding and requested a credit which was agreed to. However, US bank took months to resolve so the balance went unpaid. In fact, I never made any payment towards those fees ( which grew to {$75.00} in late charges ) because they agreed to waive them. Eventualky, the fees were credited and I assumed that their agreement to cancel the fees meant a full resolution had been reached. However, the process after they agreed to waive the fees took months. I called us bank month after month because the fee they promised to reverse was still on my statement. Each conversation a US Bank rep promised to have a "" manager '' take care of it. I did n't know that their incompetence was adversely effecting my credit. Once it showed up on my credit report, I requested a dispute through the credit bureaus as directed by US Bank since they would not provide any other assistance. I was told by us bank that there was nothing they could do. The results of the dispute merely updated the length of outstanding fees. I had a number of mortgages with us bank over the years and they were paid thousands of dollars in interest. I find it descipable a hidden fee of {$25.00} that they agreed to waive would negatively effect my credit after numerous phone calls dealing with their own incompetence. In addition, the results of the credit bureau dispute should have been a full deletion given the facts. This may be the result of laziness or biased treatment but I will continue to pursue the only acceptable resolution of full deletion from my credit report.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1603817

6/5/16,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,900XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"To Whom It May Concern : Today I had one of the most ridiculous experiences with the banking industry that I have had yet, and frankly, I 'm over it. It has literally been a comedy of incompetence and lack of professional concern from start to finish. 

I opened an account with Chase a few weeks ago. I already had a Chase Quickpay account that I used regularly to send money back and forth to my brother. I live in Florida, and currently work in California. I needed to withdraw about XXXX dollars to purchase a car, and Chase did not have any system set up where my brother could approve me for a withdrawal or add me to his account while we were in different states. 

Chase has been prompting me for about a year to open up a Chase account via Quickpay, and that seemed to be the best way to get the money fast, so I opened up a Chase Checking account. 

Before we even left the bank, it turns out people were messing things up and not caring about it. I mentioned my quickpay account BEFORE setting up the new checking account, and ASKED if they could be merged. They said "" Absolutely. '' What the employees actually did was just go ahead and delete the quickpay account so I could start a new one with the same email. Over a year of banking records tied to that account and they just deleted it WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WORD. This is technically mega-fail number one. 

Within days, I cashed a check into this account from another established Chase account ( every single account in this story belongs to Chase, which makes it more ridiculous ). Even though it was from another Chase account, the check did not cash quickly. Four or five days later, I signed into the account and the check showed cashed. I repeat, IT SHOWED CASHED AND SHOWED THE BALANCE IN MY ACCOUNT. 

Last night I tried to sign into my account and check my balance, and found my entire account blank online. I called up, and was told my account had literally been deleted, and could not be told why. 

So I went into the bank today in person to find out What on Earth is going on. I was told the check required some kind of manual verification process, and that they mailed me a letter about it? I was told, even though the check ALREADY SHOWED CASHED, that it was somehow flagged for fraud/manual approval and did not get that approval ; so they closed the entire bank account. 

Best of all, when I went into the bank today to then collect my money from my closed account, I was informed a check had been mailed ( to somewhere I no longer live, and have been telling Chase from the beginning that I do n't live there ), and that was it. I was told they could not cancel the check and issue me the money they disappeared on the spot ( which is probably incorrect, someone probably refused to do it that way because 'Policy and Procedure ' ). Why they even mailed out a check in the first place is weird considering THEY CLAIMED THEY COULD N'T VERIFY IT. 

So in summary : Chase could n't verify a cashed check from Chase account to Chase account, in over 10 days ... 
Chase actually showed the balance in the account, despite the fact they claim the check did not pass manual verification? 
Closed the entire account? FOR WHAT? 
Claim the check was not verifiable, but mailed out the money anyway? 
Failed to correct this comedy of incompetence when it was brought to their attention in person at a Chase location. 
Cashed checks go on and off like light switches with Chase? Sometimes they are approved, and then WHAM, all of a sudden they are not again? 
NEVER ONCE CALLED, EMAILED, OR ESPECIALLY PUT A NOTICE IN THAT 'IMPORTANT BANKING ALERTS ' SECTION IN YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT. 

All of this other stuff might have been understandable, or acceptable, IF THERE HAD BEEN A HALFWAY DECENT COMMUNICATION ATTEMPT, WHICH THERE WAS NOT, BEFORE CLOSING THE ACCOUNT. These are XXXX Chase fails on communication, dis",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1954631

I have XXXX loans with Wells Fargo and was having problems with the mortgage on a property I own in XXXX, CA. My bankruptcy was filed in XXXX. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage stating that I was to send my mortgage payments to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX. I began making the payments to this address. My bankruptcy was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that there was un-applied funds in the amount of {$2400.00}. I continued to make my payments but then I started receiving letters from Wells Fargo that I was behind in the payments.and was given an amount of over $ {$6000.00} that was delinquent. I never stopped making payments on the loan and provided Wells Fargo with copies of cashed money orders drawn on Wells Fargo Bank as evidence that I was making the payments so this amount has been in dispute. I also requested the loan be audited and received a letter XX/XX/XXXX that the inquiry was going to take longer than they expected and would be resolved by no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make payments to the XXXX XXXX IA address. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from an attorney, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX that Wells Fargo has turned my account over to foreclosure and was advised that a foreclosure was file on XXXX XXXX but no date for the foreclosure sale has been set.

I receive all kinds of letters, phone calls and people coming to my home saying they have been sent by the bank and trying to gain access to the inside of my home. I never received a resolution from Wells Fargo regarding the audit of the loan. I contacted Wells Fargo and explained to them that I had the money orders to prove I have been making payments and they told me my loan had not been paid since XX/XX/XXXX and that I owed approximately {$8400.00} in back payments, not included fees. I spoke to a gentleman named XXXX and he advised me to send in the copies of the money orders. This will be the third time I have provided them with proof that I have made the payments. At this point, I do n't have confidence or trust in Wells Fargo to follow through with what they promised and feel it is in my best interest to file this complaint. I have been trying to apply for a loan modification but was told I had too much income. That is impossible as I am on a fixed income ; I receive a small pension and social security. I also have been advised that the loan I was in was a deferred interest loan and was considered predatory. My mortgage balance is upside down with the additional interest due on the loan.

The problem is : this is not a debt I owe. The original bill was paid in full and I have the canceled checks proving the doctor 's office cashed them. 
Apparently, the invoice was submitted to a collection agency even though it had been paid, then re-sold to other companies, in what I assume was a list of junk debt. Most of these companies, even though they list their businesses as debt recovery services, do n't recover anything and simply repackage and resell the list to other debt recovery services that do the same. The last company to obtain the list, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, lists their business address in XXXX XXXX, MN allegedly hired the firm of Schlee & Stillman , LLC in XXXX, MA to recover the already paid debt. 
I find it disgusting that I have to waste my time, energy, and money to fight a claim that should n't even be a claim. I am tired of all these companies washing their hands with rhetoric while stating that the claim looked legitimate at the time, or that they were conducting business based on the information given to them, blah, blah, blah.

I had dental insurance and always paid my coinsurance amount prior to leaving the office. 

I called the XXXX, FL office where I was a patient, and I was told it was a clerical error on their part. The employee said someone entered a wrong code into their computer system and the XXXX office, the only XXXX XXXX office I have ever been to, was not listed as my primary or home office. Apparently, this effects insurance coverage. The employee at the XXXX office told me that she fixed the issue. 

Then, in XXXX or XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX reported the invalid debt to AWA Collections Agency. The XXXX office told me I needed to speak to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX to resolve the issue. It is extremely difficult to contact the Corporate office as they do not answer their phones or return messages. After multiple attempts over a number of days, I finally reached someone on the phone. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX acknowledged that I was incorrectly billed and sending the account to collections was an error on their part. At XXXX XXXX instruction, I received a letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX from AWA telling me the account "" has been cancelled with our office. It is as if it had never been assigned. This account has NOT been reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies, nor will it be. '' Notably, XXXX XXXX refused to communicate with me in writing on this issue. 

At some point after this I received another bill from XXXX XXXX for {$210.00}. My husband contacted them on my behalf and informed them that this was an invalid debt, and the issue had been resolved with a letter from AWA. 

Nevertheless, without any further communication from AWA or to the best of my knowledge and recollection XXXX XXXX, AWA reported this invalid debt in the amount of {$210.00} to the Credit Bureau 's on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

When I saw the collection account on my credit report, I called AWA at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to resolve the issue. Their employee told me that AWA could not remove the collection account from my credit report without XXXX XXXX instructing them to, and that I needed to speak to XXXX XXXX. The employee I spoke to did confirm that the account that was reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies was the account number ( XXXX ) that was referenced in the XXXX XXXX, XXXX cancellation letter. He also told me that the account was opened in XXXX XXXX, which along with the {$210.00} amount also suggests that it is the same account referenced in the cancellation letter. 

AWA told me that the mailed some kind of letter to me on XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They mailed this letter to an old address, I did not receive it, and nonetheless they reported this debt to the Credit Reporting Agencies on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Despite multiple requests to XXXX XXXX and AWA, to date I have never received any description of the date of service or type of services for which I am being billed. Nor, to the best of my knowledge and recollection, did I ever receive any type of denial of coverage from my dental insurance company. 

I called XXXX XXXX XXXX at or around XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and left voice messages with both the patient billing/collections department and the patient relations representative. There was also no answer at the receptionist extension. My messages have not been returned. 

Most importantly, AWA reported a disputed and invalid debt to the Credit Reporting Agencies as a collection account despite sending me a letter stating the account was cancelled and "" has NOT been reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies, nor will it be.

The website is very cryptic in indicating that a person is actually signing up for a membership and even less evident is the need to cancel the trial after a short prescribed time, with information about cancelling the account entirely being almost invisible. While I now realize that this is a common occurrence even warned about on a the FTC website, I am a bit surprised that that it was so easy to fall victim to this very misleading business practice. Below is a copy of the initial complaint letter. They have responded and denied my request. I am planning on filing an appeal. While I realize that ultimately I signed up for this service ( albeit unknowingly ), I can not sit by without voicing my concern about this predatory practice. I can not imagine that we are powerless against this company to do nothing to make it more evident and clear for consumers what they are getting into when they sign up for this service. If for nothing else, please add my complaint to the list. I would be willing to testify further. I would like to see some sort of regulation that makes it more clear about signing up for membership services. Thank you. 
XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I am requesting reimbursement of membership dues I have been charged since XXXX, 2015 when I was unknowingly signed up for your continuous credit monitoring service.

In XXXX, 2015 I accessed your website for a one-time credit report needed to submit for employment purposes. Apparently at this time I was also unknowingly signed up for a membership. I have received no invoicing documentation either electronic or post mail that I was being charged on a monthly basis. I have received no communication regarding opting out or cancelling the membership, and the process of how I was signed up was cryptic and misleading. 
As you will notice, there has been XXXX activity signing in and utilizing any membership services on this account since XXXX, when I initially accessed your website to obtain a credit report because I was interviewing for a job with a fire department. 
I am a woman on her own living in XXXX where my XXXX XXXX XXXX job barely pays for necessities. An expenditure of this sort for something I was not utilizing is a significant hardship, and I 'm very concerned because I had no reason to think Experian was taking money from my account because I was not even aware I was a member. 
In fairness, I am fully willing to pay for services I utilized that first month of membership ( {$22.00} ), however I am requesting full reimbursement of the remaining {$130.00}. 
It was a major disappointment when at the very end of a rigorous recruitment process I did not get hired for the XXXX job, and now several months later discovering that I have also lost a large amount of money as a result of this has made this scenario even more disheartening.

After several months of struggling to make the payments, I was finally enrolled into a "" Pay Down Program! '' What I later found out, is that the lady who 'd enrolled me into the program had lied to me! As a result of her lie, or "" misinformation, '' I incurred a {$1200.00} interest fee! As this woman was taking my information to put me in the program, I 'd told her that my first purchase on that card was on an 18month payoff promotion, and that it was almost paid off. The original purchase was for a {$1500.00} television, but that I only owed {$400.00} at that point, and that there was still a few month left to pay it off and that I 'd like to pay that off first because I did n't want that payment to eventually "" balloon! '' This woman insisted that I would not be able to get into the program "" without '' a promotional balance on my account. Well, I certainly could n't continue to send almost half of my XXXX check to them each month, so what could I do? She said that there was just no way that she could put me in the program, and that all of those ballooned charges would be included in my monthly payments. It was all so despicable! As a customer, who did n't file bankruptcy, who did n't just ignore the bills, but who instead, is on the phone for months trying to take responsibility for the debt I 'd created, I was horrified to find that the company I 'd decided to trust with my credit would behave this way! One woman I 'd spoken with as I was trying to find out about help, transferred me to another woman who swore up and down that she did n't know of any programs like the ones I 'd told her that the previous woman had told me about, and then after about five minutes of playing dumb, she finally admits that she works in the frekkin ' department I 'd been asking about! I could n't believe it! She was actually trying to "" hide '' the information! And no, she did n't put me into the program! I was n't able to get into the program until months later, and then that 's when I was lied to - and then hit with that {$1200.00} bill! I 've already called and requested that they pull that phone call, as I understand that they are all recorded. They called me back and told me that that phone call was "" unavailable '' and that unfortunately, they would not be able to remove that charge from my account! Well, I told them that in that case, I would certainly be talking to someone else who possibly can! They should not be allowed to get away with doing something like that! Please help! I have allowed this company, as part of the agreement, to auto debit my account {$150.00} each month for 58 months - and then I find out that I was lied to by the agent! I had been calling in for months, asking for some assistance from them until one day, I quit! I did n't send in my payment! I 'd never missed a payment. Never been late - but I was done! A couple weeks later, I 'd decided to pick up the phone again, and try again to get some help. I did n't want to let this thing destroy everything I 'd spent years to build. I was eventually put into that program at some point later! To my surprise and horror, I later found out, that because I 'd missed that ONE payment, XXXX had slapped on hundreds of dollars in late fees and penalties! My credit limit was only around {$7000.00}, but because of "" their '' activities, my starting balance when they finally put me into the program, was over {$7600.00}!

3/28/15,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,TX,787XX,Credit card,,Late fee,,"I 've had the AMEX XXXX card for seven years and it 's always been a nightmare of an experience when things go wrong. Customer service refuses to admit to mistakes and refuses to correct them. They blame the "" computer '' and act like they have no way to help if the computer does n't allow it. 
My story started with a late fee. My payment due date was on a weekend and I had previously set up autopay for situations like this when I may not be available to make the payment in full manually. I was surprised when I saw the late fee and immediately paid my balance and called to see if I could have the late fee removed. It was a {$26.00} late fee assessed on an existing balance of {$39.00}. I explained that I 'd had the card for 7 years and never been late XXXX and the rep agreed and submitted a request to have the late fee removed. The system denied it. He was unable to or unwilling to tell me why it was denied. I spent an hour on the phone with an account supervisor and then an account manager. They were all rude and unhelpful. Fuming I went online to my account to set up autopay so this never happened again. This is when I noticed that I HAD already set up autopay, all my bank info was there and accurate, autopay was just turned off. So I called American Express back and explained that I would n't have a late fee if they had n't turned off my autopay. The rep submitted a request and told me that the request went through and I should see the amount post to my account in the next 2-3 business days. 2 weeks later I check my balance and notice that there was no such credit. I called American Express again. This time I talked to the rudest rep of all who just kept telling me that the late fee was a valid charge and there was nothing he could do about it. Sensing I was getting nowhere with this guy and tired of his rude attitude that was making me angry I asked to speak to a supervisor. After 10 min more a supervisor got on the phone and I spend 5-10 minuted rehashing all the details of my problem. She said that all she could do was again try to submit a request to the system to remove the late fee but gave no guarantees. She put me on hold and came back 5 min later saying that the system denied my request. She was also unable or unwilling to tell me why. At this point I gave up, told her that my experience with them had been terrible and I was a extemely unhappy customer. The fact they claim their system is so ridgid and in no case can they override its parameters is utterly unbelievable. I know they can, they just refuse to. I 've had worse account history with mastercard and visa accounts that HAVE reimbursed me for late fees when I call in. I 've said that I would never use this card again before and then been suckered into using it because XXXX ONLY accepts americanexpress for some reason. However this time I shredded the card and all my AMEX cards. I will go to great lengths to not use AMEX anymore. They are a terrible terrible company.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1306098

Near the time of submitting the payment, Navinet compounded the interest ( or add it to ) the overall amount that I borrowed, essentially charging me interest on top of interest.

Apparently the debt has been sold numerous times to various collection agencies. I received a call XXXX days ago from a company called National Check Recovery, a gentleman named "" XXXX XXXX '' stated I would be receiving papers for fraud as the loan was n't paid off. I called the number and reached National Check Recovery/XXXX, who stated I would be served with papers for fraud. I spoke with customer service at XXXX and they stated they do not work with this company in any way. 

The original loan with XXXX was for {$500.00}. I requested a validation of the debt, which shows the debt as over {$900.00} more than the pay day loan, but if they had to sue me it would be nearly {$3000.00}. I received the validation from them but there was not an itemized list of the charges. I spoke with XXXX XXXX today and he became verbally abusive with me, threatening to sue for fraud as I did n't pay the loan off. 

I told this gentleman I had not received any notice of this debt from their company and their threatening phone call was the first I had heard from them. XXXX XXXX told me they had sent "" numerous '' notices by mail, but would not provide me with proof of this as I told him I had received nothing. I was unable to even speak an entire sentence during the conversation as he continued to interrupt, yell, and speak over me to the point where I had to firmly inform him that I would cease communication with him if he did not stop interrupting and raising his voice. 

I am meeting with an attorney tomorrow and told XXXX XXXX I would be showing the paperwork to the attorney. XXXX XXXX demanded to know the attorney name and address and phone number, which I did not share with him because I have not retained the attorney formally. He became quite verbally upset with me when he found out I was speaking with an attorney and asked what I was trying to "" accomplish ''. 

I asked to speak with the XXXX XXXX, who left the original message a number of times over the last XXXX days, yesterday I was told he was "" out to lunch and would call me back in about XXXX minutes '' and I never received the call. I called XXXX more times yesterday and asked for him and never received a call back. I asked again today to speak with XXXX XXXX and was told he does n't work there and is a process server.

Contrarily, Citimortgage has informed us that is not the case. We purchased our home in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX we began investigating ways to refinance the loan, however we were denied because of a reduction in home prices and income due to a job loss. By XXXX we began inquiring with Citimortgage about a loan modification, which we believed was possible through the Home Affordable Refinance Program. The process was painful and repetitive, involving multiple requests for similar documents worsened by changes in Citi staff, who often showed a lack of knowledge and concern for us. Miraculously, by the summer of XXXX we were able to successfully modify our loan, which saved us a modest {$400.00} a month. Throughout the process we understood that we were modifying our current loan. However, recently, when I inquired about the PMI, Citimortgage informed me that we actually had completed a conventional refinance, changing the LTV to the new loan price at the time of the XXXX closing. I disputed this understanding and was told that I should reference the promissory note, which I did. On the top of the document is prominently written, Consolidated Note and states that this note consolidates, extends, and modifies existing loan. We are confused. Furthermore, I suffered a job loss which caused loss of income and our home value had dropped significantly, precluding us from obtaining a conventional loan. We brought this to the attention of a friendly Branch Manager who reviewed our mortgage on an electronic database on her computer. She expressed some concern about the information then said that she could not speak to me about the matter. I asked her if she could refer me to an agent with whom I could speak.

2/9/16,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,MD,210XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"Dear CFPB, I had a checking account with TD bank, which seems like was overdrawn by error. I had linked my TD Bank to my XXXX credit card. By error it seems like the software submitted multiple ACH requests. 

I learned from TD bank that I was negative ~ {$200.00}, however, in less than 4-5 weeks, TD bank charged me more than {$250.00} in fees. They sent this amount to collection and closed my account. 

I am XXXX years old. I had only XXXX checking account. I am kindly requesting TD bank to please reopen my account and please remove the fees. I want to pay the overdrawn amount ASAP. Please ask the collection agency to not send this to credit agencies, otherwise it will damage my credit history. My credit score was close to XXXX, which now might have been damaged significantly. 

I will greatly any help from TD Bank. I was traveling XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX has already removed all Fees associated with these ACH debits. 

I apologize to TD Bank. 

I will greatly appreciate if you can help here. 

Thank you.",,Older American,Web,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1778114

The notice said that we would receive information about how to make payments, and that our monthly payments would not change from the previous company 's amount. By XXXX XXXX, we had not received an identifiable account number, statement or payment book, so we twice called the number on the postal notice.

By XXXX XXXX, none had arrived. We went to the SLS website and attempted to set up a payment account to make online payments.

I am a lawful permanent resident with a XXXX XXXX. During XXXX season of XX/XX/XXXX I purchased some items from XXXX XXXX in XXXX Florida. I have enough money to buy things, but the ladies at the counter informed me, "" If you open a XXXX XXXX card, you will get 15 % discount ''. I applied for the card on the spot in order to avail of the discount. In their application form they insisted I give the street address. At my street address there was no mail box. We used a PO box in the same city. I informed the clerks that no mail comes to our residence address because we do not have a mail box on the property but we have a PO box . The clerks informed me that I needed to enter my street address, so I did that. XXXX XXXX sent me the card and statement, presumably to the street address, so they were obviously returned to them by the post office. XXXX months later I get a phone call from XXXX XXXX informing me I had to pay the bill and a fine for late payment. I informed them I was willing to pay for the goods I purchased, but not the fine because it was not my fault that I had not got the bill/card/statement. I then went to the store in XXXX Florida where I had purchased the goods. I paid for the goods using my XXXX, credit card, spoke to the manager/clerks there, explained to them that I did not need any credit from XXXX XXXX because I have enough money. I had only applied for their card because their clerks had cheerfully informed me about the 15 % discount if I applied for XXXX XXXX card. I explained in detail about not having a mail box on my property. I talked to the manager/clerks as well as the XXXX XXXX person who they had dialed. I asked the XXXX XXXX representative who was on the phone, "" I am paying only for the goods I had bought, I want you to take that penalty off and confirm it is done. I just made payment right now at this store as we are talking ''. He/she who was on the phone informed me "" Yes I have taken your penalty amount off in view of what you have told me ''. "" Please confirm that I owe NOTHING to you now ''. He/she who was on the phone said, "" Yes the balance shows as XXXX ''. To my surprise, a few months later I get another phone call from XXXX XXXX, asking me to pay the penalty. For the XXXX time I explained the entire situation to them. Few weeks later I got another letter from XXXX XXXX demanding me to pay up. I sent them a letter explaining for the XXXX time. I then got a letter from a debt collection company, then I kept getting letters and phone calls from debt collection companies. I was new to the United States and did not know that XXXX XXXX had the power to ruin my "" credit score '' because I did not know there was such a thing as "" credit score ''. My wife had advised me, "" Best pay what they want '' but I thought because I had done no wrong, and XXXX XXXX had done something wrong, nothing bad would happen to me. I was surprised to learn that I had something called "" credit score '' and it was a XXXX score because XXXX XXXX had reported "" non-payment '' of dues, or something like that. 
I wanted to sue them but I was just a XXXX and did not have the money to sue them. I realized that though I had recourse to a court of law and could sue XXXX XXXX ; I could not do anything because I did not have the money to pay a lawyer 's fees. The only lawyer I contacted asked me for {$5000.00} for starters. I did not have even {$500.00} to give him, so I learned not to apply for any store credit cards like XXXX XXXX. The damage XXXX XXXX did to me was unjust but they got away with it because I do not have money to sue them. I guess they know that we are too XXXX to sue them, so they use this ruse to rake in money. If they can siphon off {$100.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX people like me by unjust threats and by attacking our credit scores, they will be richer by {$100.00} XXXX.

My letter requested them to validate the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed, a verification or copy of any judgment, and proof that they are licensed to collect debt in the state of Ohio. I had received no prior written communication from this company and asked them to send me details on a debt they say I owe in writing only. The number they are contacting me on is a work phone number that I do not own and I do not use for personal business. Doing so is a violation of the agreement I have with my employer for it use. I received a reply from Midland Credit Management dated XXXX/XXXX/15 stating that they are unable to locate an account in their system for me and that additional information is needed. I was asked to send a Full account number, social security number, address or previous address, full name, and phone number. I could not provide them with an account number as I had received no communication from them with an account number or an original creditor. I also am not willing to provide a social security number to a business that states it has business with me but can not clarify what the business is. My address, phone number, and full name were provided in the letter I sent. Despite MCM claiming to not be able to locate a record for me, the calls did stop for a time.

I provided the agent with my cell phone number and informed them I would call them back as soon as I was able.

I have written Capital One Bank to have the inquiry removed from my credit file, but received no response. I have sent the complaint letter certified mail but I received no response to this issue. I kindly asked the Capital One Bank to forward me documentation that I have had on file or removed it all together. The creditor did not have authorization to inquire into my credit report as a breach may have taken place and my social security # has been compromised. 

Capital One Bank did not bother to respond or provide documentation that a credit inquiry was authorized by me. I am complaining about the deceptive and unclear authorization form supposedly I received to acquire such inquiry. The creditors have ignored my challenge which I sent Certified Mail Return Receipt Requested and kept track of the time that I sent the letter. By law if the inquiring creditor does n't respond within about thirty days. I have ample grounds to demand some action. At that point, it 's almost irrelevant whether or not you authorized the inquiry. This has becomes about the creditor 's lack of response to a consumer dispute.

Cleaning Fee {$70.00} ... I had been a tenant at XXXX for more than seven years and have always maintained a clean apartment. NC landlords are required to clean all apartments before a new tenant moves in. In no way did my vacated apartment require excess cleaning. 
Sealed Floors {$100.00} ... I have no responsibility for sealing the floors ( see below under carpet from leak ). 
Paint & Primer {$1000.00} ... In NC, there exists a standard in landlord law that requires new paint in remtal units at least every three years. I spackled and sanded every single nail hole in every wall so the apartment was paint ready when I vacated. There were no other holes or other damage to the walls or ceiling when I vacated the apartment. I have photographic evidence of this as well. Also, the fact that they are trying to charge me {$1000.00} to paint a XXXX sq. ft. apartment is further evidence that they are trying to extort money from me with the threat of legal action. 
Carpet from leak {$450.00} ... There is no way I am responsible for carpet which is 10-12 years old and completely depreciated. Also, I was offered new carpet upon lease renewal, however, I refused because I did n't want a rent increase and to have to worry about every little spot on the carpet. The leak was not my fault and was due to "" old & brittle '' plastic water pipes, the fact that XXXX, the onsite maintenance technician, chose not to respond to my emergency call because "" he was not on call '' ( which he later admitted to me that he should have responded ), the three hour delay for XXXX, the other maintenance tech, ( who lives an hour away ) to get there and XXXX XXXX. negligence in replacing the old, brittle pipes, as similar breaks had recently occurred ... .one in the building that XXXX , the maintenance tech lives in! 
XXXX Water Bill {$70.00} ... I had no problem paying the final water bill and I did pay it after I received it '' and the final water bill was {$23.00}. This is another attempt by XXXX XXXX. to extort money from me and fraudulently inflate charges. 
In review, XXXX XXXX. are dishonest, corrupt and knowingly committing fraud by charging tenants for planned upgrades, maintenance required by law, depreciated items and items which have been already replaced by outgoing tenants. I urge you to remove this collection from my Experian report who have lied about forwarding documentation to XXXX and refuse to let me get a word in edgewise in my phone conversations to them. I do n't have a scanner, however, I can attach documents in a separate email.

7/19/16,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,FL,325XX,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Taking out the loan or lease,,"I financed my vehicle through Wells Fargo Dealer Services. This is was a {$14000.00} loan originated in XXXX XXXX, current balance in {$4800.00} or so. 

The loan is under XXXX XXXX, number XXXX. 

For some impossible to find reason, Wells Fargo increased my monthly payment from about {$240.00} to almost $ XXXX. Please be advised that my monthly statements only show the payment amount, but nothing about the source and breakdown of the payment. 

There was no documentation whatsoever as of why this was increased. I called Wells Fargo several times and finally got someone extremely rude who stated that since they were unable to verify my insurance information - and they added their own insurance to my premium. 

This is when the nightmare started ( about 2 months ago ). I provided Well Fargo with my policy insurance number and told them that the vehicle has never been uninsured. We switched policies ( from XXXX XXXX to XXXX ) about 10 months ago. The vehicle has been insured continuously, with the required collision and comprehensive options. 

I was told that I can not submit the declarations page and proof of insurance myself and that Wells Fargo will take care of it and remove the bogus charges. 

As of today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) I have called and spoke to at least XXXX account reps, XXXX more useless than the other. Every time I call I have to explain from A-Z that my car is and was ALWAYS insured, and that we changed providers 10+ months ago, and that there was XXXX correspondence from Wells Fargo ( written, emails, phone calls, etc ) to address this issue. 

Everytime the reps 'promise ' me that they will rectify the issue and issue refunds for all my overpayments. This never happened, therefore, I will stop making payments and seek legal action against Wells Fargo asap. 

I find it despicable that what is supposed to be a reputable business ( Wells Fargo ) treats its paying customers like garbage and demonstrates unbelievable incompetence. All reps I spoke to were rude, condescending and 0 help. I must mention that I was always polite and nice ( recorded conversations can prove my point ). 


Bottom line is : my car has been insured since the day I bought it. It is fully covered as of today, by XXXX policy # XXXX ( effect XXXX to XXXX ), with the required collision/comprehensive coverages and Wells Fargo listed as the finance company. 

I offered several times to fax/email/mail declarations pages going back to XXXX ( even for when I had XXXX XXXX ) and ran into brick walls. 

I demand that all my overpayments be credited to my account, along with statements that actually detail what the payments are for ( breakdown - principal, interest and illegally added insurance ). 

Until this matter is resolved, I will stop making any payments. Should any negative information be posted on my credit file, I plan on suing Well Fargo and forwarding an open complaint letter to all media outlets and my state consumer protection office. 

I believe what Wells Fargo is doing in not only morally wrong, but also highly illegal - as there is no paper trail they can use to justify the almost doubling of a fixed payment installment loan. 

Please note that I intend to escalate this matter to the highest level, along with initiating legal action and involving media channels. There is no excuse for this type of behavior from Wells Fargo Dealer Services.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,No,Yes,2018411

I asked her if she was required to verify and give the mini Miranda and she ignored my question and kept confirming my name. I asked her to transfer me to a manager. The manager got on the phone and I informed him of what just happened. I asked him the same questions and he told me nothing but who I called and if I wanted to resolve the debt. I then asked him if he was a third party agency and he ignored my question. The manager did not verify or give me the mini Miranda. I then asked to speak to his manager.

4/5/16,DISCOVER BANK,NY,130XX,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"I have previously submitted a report on XXXX XXXX, and now I would like to submit my complaint with Discover. 

I have XXXX Discover loans, XXXX being 8.8 % interest equaling {$11000.00} ( {$10000.00} originally ) and the other being 7.2 % interest equaling {$19000.00} ( {$18000.00} originally ). 

The problem with the loan is NOT the amount, rather the fraudulent interest rates I am being charged. Because the interest continues to compound, my payments barely eat into the principal leaving me with a bigger loan than I started. 

I make every payment on time, however it seems to make little difference if I pay more than what is due. This is ruining my credit report because my debt to income ratio looks horrible, even though I make all my payments on time. 

What this is effectively doing is keeping me from getting any sort of loan to buy a house, or put a dime back into the economy. It does appear as though this will be the case for a long while unless something is down to lower my interest rates to an acceptable level. 

Paying $ XXXX- {$1200.00} a month in student loans is not feasible when I am barely cutting into the principal and lowering the loan amount. In every case of my loans, they are now currently bigger than when I first received them even though I am paying this amount of money EACH month. This should not be allowed and is a form of loan sharking. 

I am not asking for my loans to be forgiven, however I am asking that my interest rates be put at a normal level of almost all other loans in this country at 2 % interest. There is no reason I should be suffering from an fraudulent interest rate ; students should not be punished for seeking a higher education. 

After calling each of these companies several times, I have found NO help in trying to refinance my loans. The only option I get is to go into forbearance, which would mean a lifetime of debt for me and possibly other family members. 

Please review my case and understand where I am coming from. I can not express enough how these interest rates undermine my consumer rights.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1865676

These unfair practices, bullying and errors have resulted in them not allowing me to process payments, applying payments by me incorrectly or not at all, and then prematurely placing me in foreclosure.

I repeatedly stated I did not want the repayment plan but they left me on it, then when I tried to make a payment, I was told since I did not make the repayment plan payment in the month ( 3rd ) month it was due, the plan broke and I denied and my file was referred to a foreclosure attorney.

I have been talking with Navient for about 10 months now and have not been able to work out our issues. I am hoping you will be able to help me. 

My major issue is that Navient has my name on XXXX separate private loans that they claim I cosigned for, yet XXXX of the promissory notes does not have my signature on it ( loan is for {$7000.00}, but final charge was {$7200.00} as seen in the paperwork ). The other XXXX loans DO have my signature and I understand that I am responsible for them, but I will not agree to pay on the {$7000.00} loan until they provide me copies of documents that I actually signed. Navient assures me that they have a signed document on file, however they have sent us XXXX copies of the "" master promissory notes '' ( XXXX to myself and XXXX to my mother ) and there is no signature on that document in each packet. I keep calling back and requesting to speak to the department that sends out the documents, but am told that department does answer phones or speak to customers. Seems strange!! 

I am willing to work out a settlement with Navient and they have agreed to a 65 % settlement of the XXXX loans combined, but I do not want to agree to that until I am positive that I truly signed the promissory note for the {$7000.00}. I am really looking to get my name released from the {$7000.00} loan that I never actually agreed to and will make a settlement on the remaining debt. I have only attached the unsigned promissory note, but can certainly provide you with all XXXX of the promissory notes they have sent me if you should need them. 

I do not seem to be getting anywhere with Navient at this point and am requesting your assistance in this matter. I am a responsible person, am well educate, have paid back all of my own school loans in entirety and I am willing to pay back a reasonable settlement on behalf of my mother.

The dealer contacted the previous owner and it took the owner some time to give the dealer a copy. Once the dealer received the copy we processed the title immediately, but Lendmark Financial had to update their information with the Virginia DMV in order to get the title. Lendmark claimed they could n't get in touch with the DMV and did not know what to do. I got in touch with the DMV and found out what to do, sent the form to Lendmark and processed a title copy for the third time. I did not miss a payment and I kept open communication through out the entire process. Lendmark Financial placed a judgment on my husband 's and my credit report. When I called to see if the title was received they confirmed that they had it. I then asked if the judgment could be removed since we made sure the company received the title. The branch manager ( XXXX ) was very rude and stated that the judgment would not be removed until the loan was paid in full. I replied that there were no payments missed and reminded her that I made sure they received the title. I also told her that I was not going to pay until they removed the judgment.

I have had a processor assisting me with completing the application pursuant to the information that has been provided by the many representatives at Fedloan Servicing. Every time I 've spoke to them, they illustrate a different way to complete the application. My loans are a spousal consolidation and thus require that I submit my ex-spouses information- of which she has complied with as well. My application was finally approved back in XXXX of 2016 and then was arbitrarily placed back into the standard payment with the claim that there was missing information. I have since escalated the file and submitted another application that two months later still has not processed. I have been told that my file has been escalated and should have resolved within 3-5 days- yet here we are 3 months later with a mandatory student loan debt burden forbearance on my file because I have not been able to pay back my loans in over two years. I have submitted all of the requested documents exactly as described to Fedloan servicing. My file has been pending to be place in the revised pay as you earn plan for almost two years. Fedloan servicing has made me jump through hoops in order to obtain a repayment plan that they have told me I qualify for. It 's very frustrating that it has taken this long for my application to process and the representatives do n't understand why.

She informed me that she would not be able to cash my check and deposit the balance, but that she would be able to deposit the check and give me {$200.00} withdrawal, and that the rest would be available to me today. I asked if it would be the same as depositing my check at the ATM, and she advised me it would not because I would not be given the same available balance. So I said that would be fine. She proceeded to ask me to initial my deposit slip where she crossed out my initial deposit amount of {$1000.00}. She asked how my day was and I told her it was going good and that it was actually moving along pretty fast so it was great for a Friday. She was professional and courteous. She asked if there was anything else I needed today before she handed me the {$200.00} completed the transaction, and I said no. She handed me the {$200.00} along with my receipt and I left. I came back to the office and in reviewing my bank receipt I noticed my available balance was {$0.00} not what the teller had informed me 15 minutes prior. I called the branch to see if my transaction could be reversed. I asked the bank associate who answered the phone if I would be able to get the transaction reversed and she advised me that she would n't be able to as all of the work had just been turned in. I voiced my displeasure by telling her that this was not the first time the bank had given me wrong information and that it was very inconvenient. The associate asked me what had happened and as I began to tell her, she interrupted me, I allowed her to finish asking me the exact same question she had just asked, and I asked her if she would allow me to answer her question or if she was asking me just to ask me. She replied by telling me that she did n't need me to be rude. I informed her that she should allow a customer to answer a question as opposed to not allowing them to by speaking over them, I then asked her name she stated her is XXXX XXXX and identified herself as the assistant manager. She than asked me to let her know what happened. I informed her of the issue and she agreed that the information I was provided was incorrect and that there was nothing she could do. I again voiced my displeasure by telling her I was tired of this bank not owning up and correcting their mistakes, she said ok, and we ended the call.

10/29/16,PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC.,FL,322XX,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"A person who has purchased several of the exact same items from me on eBay opened a case about an item not arriving. The item was shipped with tracking and everything required to be covered by eBay 's seller policy. I contacted eBay, they ruled in my favor and closed the case XX/XX/XXXX. The buyer turned around and then said the item did arrive but was not as described, opening another case with eBay. I once again called eBay and they closed the case in my favor again XX/XX/XXXX. Both times the amount of the transaction was immediately taken from my paypal account. Despite being covered by both eBay and PayPal seller policies. Both eBay and PayPal had immediate access to the shipping label with tracking I printed through eBay, paid for via PayPal. For some reason the XXXX transaction did not get credited back to my account. I figured it was a simple error, and I sent PayPal an email saying the cases have been closed, there is no reason why the funds should not be credited back to my account XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of resolving the matter, I got a boilerplate frequently asked questions response to my email on XX/XX/XXXX. The entire day passed and I was sent other money. I logged into my paypal and noticed the funds still had not been credited back to my account. I proceeded to call PayPal. The first representative was not helpful, refused to call eBay, and transferred me to PayPal dispute. Despite the fact no dispute had ever been opened directly with PayPal. The another operator, XXXX # XXXX proceeded to explain to me various stuff and waste my time. A few times I was told the funds are still on hold because the case was closed. I requested they call eBay upwards of 3 times. They denied my request, and proceeded to waste my time. When I requested a supervisor I was put on hold, and then hung up on. I then noticed a credit to my account. This is ridiculous, and a financial transaction company should not make such mistakes, nor treat customers this way. eBay and PayPal are different companies now. The only time money should be taken from my PayPal account regarding an eBay transaction is when eBay has ruled against me. The present policy is that as soon as a case is opened, despite the seller being covered by seller protection by eBay and PayPal. PayPal immediate takes the funds from the sellers account. No matter if they are at fault or not. In both these situations as all thus far eBay has ruled in my favor. PayPal has never had justification to take money from me. I do not get interest on the funds while they are taken from me. I do not believe PayPal is immediately crediting the buyer and then taking the money from them if the case is not ruled in their favor. Thus Paypal is doing this to get money that is neither in the sellers or buyers account. This should not be legal.

XXXX card member services was attempting to collect a credit card debt from me for the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX credit card that also had my name, XXXX XXXX listed on it. I attempted to resolve this with XXXX XX/XX/2015 to no avail, by the following methods : 1 ) Telephone requests to provide proof that I, XXXX XXXX, was personally liable for this XXXX account. 
2 ) Written request for copy of personal liability for business account-by certified letter dated XX/XX/2015 ( see copy being mailed ). 
XXXX responded with a letter dated, XX/XX/2015 claiming that I was the responsible party for the account according "" to their records '' ( see copy being mailed ). 
.On XX/XX/2015 XXXX sent me a letter stating : "" Action Needed : Make a payment right away to prevent your account from charge off '' ( see copy being mailed ). 
I filed an online complaint with the cfpb regarding XXXX on XX/XX/2015 ( see copy being mailed ). 
On or about XX/XX/2015, a collection company called me personally about collecting the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card debt, at which time I told then that I had just filed a dispute with the XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The collection agent said that they would then send this back to XXXX. 
XXXX then discharged the debt, and sent me a XXXX in the amount of {$8400.00} on XX/XX/2015. 
While the above information was being sought by me, and before the demand letter from XXXX was issued to me on XX/XX/2015, ( see enclosed ) XXXX must have issued derogatory information regarding me personally to the credit bureaus because on XX/XX/2015, XXXX reduced my credit line on my actual personal credit card account, which negatively impacted my FICO score. 
My personal XXXX credit card issuer then followed suit and reduced my credit line impacting my FICO score even further. 
This discharge of the debt has caused my personal FICO score to drop even further and it is my belief that it has caused me to be denied for auto loans, and for an SBA loan for Disaster Relief due to Hurricane XXXX. 
I would like the following relief : 1 ) Remove the charge off from my credit report. 
2 ) Compensate me for the {$8400.00} that was issued on the XXXX XXXX ) Raise my credit limit on my personal XXXX card to it 's former status. 
4 ) Provide me with a loan in the amount and interest rate ( 1.9 % ) that the SBA denied me, due to XXXX 's wanton and malicious maligning of my credit",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2254523

On top being forced to take responsibility for fraudulent loans, I am now having these accounts re-aged. For clarity, there are XXXX loans each consisting of XXXX, the servicer, XXXX, the guarantor, and US depart of ED, the lender/collection agency. The credit bureaus and FCRA clearly state that for collection accounts included defaulted student loans the negative information ( collection/default ) will remain on your credit report up to 7 years from the date of the first delinquency leading to collection/default ( Documents XXXX and XXXX ). As noted of Document XXXX, my XXXX credit report dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the account history with the servicer ( XXXX ) for XXXX loans clearly states the date of my first delinquency leading to collection/default "" 30 days past due "" as of XXXX XXXX '' ( Document XXXX ) and Document XXXX ( XXXX in XXXX report on XX/XX/XXXX with history from XXXX and XXXX reporting such. Oddly Equifax is not ) with removal date of XXXX XXXX. Back to Document XXXX, once in default the guarantor, XXXX is also reporting both accounts on my credit report as opened/defaulted/collection on XXXX XXXX. However this is not the date the seven year clock starts as again the date of first delinquency was as previously stated "" as of XXXX XXXX ''. Furthermore as reported on the same account info with the XXXX, the date of removal is not 7 years form collection but to continue on record to XXXX XXXX, in agreement with the original date of delinquency. ( Document XXXX ). I received correspondence from the director of the guarantor agency as I was continuing to dispute the accounts as fraud and provide documentation ( Document XXXX ) Again the date of first delinquency is clear on XXXX XXXX and XXXX of XXXX XXXX. As seen in document XXXX, the XXXX accounts were now in collection with the Dept of ED on my Equifax credit reports of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and up to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the original date of delinquency was that of XXXX XXXX. ( Note- As of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts had already fallen off my XXXX credit report yet, oddly, only XXXX of the XXXX loans had fallen off my XXXX report ( I will come back to XXXX in one moment ). As seen in document XXXX, however, between XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as seen on my Equifax credit reports when the date the accounts should be falling off my Equifax credit report was approaching the date of first delinquency changed for both accounts to XXXX XXXX as did the entire payment history. I.e. the accounts were reaged. I disputed the XXXX XXXX account again whose investigation results are seen in document XXXX, which now had no history, and updated status, but a message to contact the creditor. I also disputed XXXX accounts through Equifax and my current report is seen in XXXX XXXX. Although the status is stating reinvestigation in process I have contacted XXXX the creditor at the number provided by XXXX and Equifax and all calls were recorded. In short, XXXX informed me the account will be removed on XXXX XXXX of this year. Despite providing the documentation to Equifax, and how the account was updated by their own bureau they put the blame on the creditor. The creditor was extremely rude, claimed not to be the one who verified the dispute, would not inform me who is verifying the information nor whom to contact and blamed it on the bureau ( Equifax ). I can provide all recordings if needed. I am asking that Equifax remove these accounts immediately as according to the FCRA and their own reports the original date of delinquency has been re-aged and accounts should have fallen off report a month ago. Thank you for your assistance.

10/19/16,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,330XX,Credit reporting,,Improper use of my credit report,Received marketing offer after opted out,"I 'm not sure that this is the correct option for this particular complaint. Here is the issue : I was told by a local government job placement training to check my credit report to enhance my chances of getting a job. I was told to go to XXXX, and that it was a free service. Indeed, when you first log onto XXXX, it says that it is completely free ( see screen capture attached ). All throughout the application process, it says that the service is free. 

I do n't remember ever going to the official Experian website. But I do remember agreeing to paying {$1.00} to find out what my credit rating was. Being that I am unemployed and have no substantial source of income, that is all I could afford to pay. 

Today, Experian withdrew {$21.00} from my checking account. When I called them, they said it was because I had logged on to XXXX, which is owned by Experian, and that I had agreed to pay the {$1.00} charge, but that since I did not cancel my membership after 7 days, I was charged {$21.00}. 

So, I went directly to the Experian website and at the top of that site, it says that you can get your Credit Report for {$1.00}. No mention is made regarding a "" membership '' or a {$21.00} charge. In that same section is the call to action button, which says "" Get Your Credit Report and XXXX Score. '' If you click on that button, which you normally would after reading what it says above it, you will have missed what it says only if you scroll down that page, in fine print -- that the {$1.00} charge is in fact a membership fee that turns into an additional {$21.00} after 7 days. 

This is HIGHLY MISLEADING AND FALSE ADVERTISING, especially if it is linked to the XXXX site. 

Also in the process of filling out the information for XXXX, I remember reading that, if you make false statement to Experian, you will be prosecuted by the Justice Department. I do n't remember where exactly I read this, but I was shocked because it gave the impression that credit report agencies are part of the federal government, which is misleading.

There are XXXX choices to choose from to make a payment, non of which state that your account may be delinquent. Per the representatives that I spoke to today, XXXX/XXXX/2017, ( lastly was XXXX in collections ) my account was delinquent even though my payment history would reflect otherwise.

I was never advised that by doing so, I would still not be bringing my account current. I have been using my card without issue once payments have been made. Per the account payment screen, if I click option XXXX, I make my minimum amount due payment- which I do monthly. 

I believe that the "" delinquent amounts '' should be shown on any XXXX of the XXXX lines of options to pay each month.

I have been a loyal customer of JCP for years and I feel taken advantage of and sadly believe that the only reason I had XXXX late fees waived was because I understand UDAAP and was able to explain the Deceptive and Abusive features of their online payment system. For others without this knowledge, I fear they are being taken advantage of. 

I am very unhappy and will no longer be shopping at JCP. I will work monthly to pay off my account. I was told by both representatives that they would place a "" complaint '' in their system.

I talked Ocwen about a refiner but they only offered me a modification loan. now I have payed my loan down to only XXXX and Ocwen sent me a modification statement where I was going to have to repay XXXX and have a ballon payment at the end of the loan of XXXX I told them that was insane I would basically be starting over on a loan that I have been paying on for 11 years. They told me I had to pay {$630.00} dollars by XX/XX/XXXX so I did that and I never heard back from them till I called them in XXXX XXXX, they agreed that no one had gotten back with to find out where I was with my loan. 
Then at XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter from XXXX that they have sold my 2nd mortgage to another company, that loan was down to XXXX dollars, now this new company is telling me that I have to pay XXXX dollars now for this new loan. It 's like every time I pay the finance charges on this 2nd mortgage it gets sold and I have to start over again with a new company. At this rate I would never pay this loan off, it just seems so unfair and no one else will refinance because I 'm behind, and Ocwen is telling me that they will not except any monthly payments until I pay the full XXXX to get the loan caught up. I do n't know what to do????? Where to turn, I feel like I 'm trapped in these loans with no hope of ever paying them off. Is there any help for me other than just walking away from these loans. I want to keep my house I have put a new roof on the house and in the process of replacing the old windows with new vinyl windows. And a lot of work on the out side that was covered up with putty and thick paint to hide all of the trouble spots when I bought this house and 11 years later they showing up big time. Any advice? What is my next move. My address is XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX , South Carolina . XXXX, my phone # is XXXX, and my email is XXXXXXXXXXXX please give some advice.

Once the note was transferred, I was notified that there was an overage in my escrow account and received an escrow analysis showing the overage of {$1100.00}. OCWEN informed me that I could not keep the money in the escrow account, so I chose to have the funds dispersed to me. In XXXX, OCWEN dispersed {$1800.00} from my escrow account to my insurance company for hazard insurance on schedule, leaving a negative balance of $ XXXX. The negative balance grew until I was notified of the payment increase. 

In XXXX, my mortgage statement stated that my payment would increase from {$180.00} to {$350.00}, with no explanation. When I contacted OCWEN, it was discovered that there was no escrow analysis on file to justify the payment increase. The Customer Service Representative I connected with was unable to explain any reason for the increase. With no acceptable explanation, I was transferred to an Escalation Manager. It was at this time that I requested an escrow analysis to determine the reason for the increase in my payment. Upon receiving the analysis, I then was informed that my payment would increase an additional {$91.00} to cover a projected shortage of {$3200.00} in equal payment spread out over 36 months. 

While trying to discuss this issue with XXXX different escalation managers, I became increasingly frustrated as I was continually given different answers to my questions as to how the insurance could have been overlooked. The second Escalation Manager, which I spoke with, tried to explain to me that OCWEN was doing me a favor by spreading out the shortage that was an oversight on their part. I was never given any option on how to rectify the situation. Each person I spoke with, insisted that an escrow analysis was only required once a year. Which, at this point, was one year from the time the note was transferred. 

At that point, I was able to speak to a Consumer Ombudsman. It was n't until my second call to an Ombudsman, did I receive any credible information.

No incite or offer to apply for hardship was suggested, As a result my account accrued have many late charges and an extreme increase in interest rates, subsequently the balance is still close to the starting amount of {$7000.00} from this cards inception. 

I called customer service on XX/XX/2016 to obtain more detailed explanation for the unchanged balance. I explained that I could not see history outside of a few months on the website and I asked for the history of payment and interest charges increase dates and amounts.

When I asked to speak with a manager who could assist me I was transferred to representative XXXX who rebuttable and told me that he would transfer me to counseling and he abruptly hung up on. I called back again and got corporate on the phone and was finally provided with an address to submit this grievance. 

As I queried for resolution of this problem, I was transferred to the associate XXXX who told me that high balance is interest charges stemming from unpaid Timely promotional balances.

Interest is roughly about $ XXXX monthly with an interest rate increased to over 25 %. The interest rate is not on my statement I had to ask what the interest rate has increased to. This card has been frequently accruing late charges because of remaining inability to pay the high payment. 

I am requesting that Home Depot apply all interest payments made on this account to the principal amount left on the Credit card. Then return the interest rate to the original rate in addition, I am request that all the late charges be returned and applied to the principal balance amount.

Riverview Law Office sent a letter the next day with an Excel spreadsheet I could barly read that only listed XXXX claiming overpayment of {$13000.00} and no actual information on how the amount was calculated or what pay periods were that I was overpaid. Riverview Law Office, PLLC did not include any information on them being licensed to collect in MN and no license number. 

Both letters they have sent warn me to get an attorney. 

There is no documentation or order stating I do owe XXXX {$13000.00}. 

They also did not provide the requested license information so for all I know, they are not collecting for fairview and this is all a sham.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1872366

I recently re-enrolled in an income based repayment plan with Navient. After doing so my student loan payments doubled what I was paying originally. I have contacted Navient and asked them if there is anything else I can do to lower my payments and they informed me that if I come out of the income based repayment plan that my payments would be higher. The only way for them to factor in only my income is for me to file my taxes married filling separate. I am trying so hard to manage my current student loan payments that is higher than my monthly mortgage payment and am wondering will there ever be a day any time soon when student loan repayments will be based solely on the income of the individual who has the debt and not the household income? Without me having to change how I file my taxes. After I pay my student loans I am unable to contribute anything else to my household.

The hold time was very extensive. Subsequently, a representative who provided the name of XXXX answered, and then verified by password and other information. I seldom dial your Customer Service Department ; however, upon reviewing my online account, I noticed that a NSF charge dated XX/XX/2016 was assessed to my account. I asked XXXX when the returned item was presented to Compass Bank for payment. XXXX told me to hold for a brief moment, and before I could respond, he had placed me hold. After holding several minutes, XXXX hung up. I want the call reviewed. And I want XXXX discipline. 
Basic customer service training should require that Compass ' telephone representatives ask to place a customer on hold, and then wait for a response. Further, under no circumstances should a representative hang up on a customer, particularly since he knew the office would be closing soon. Presumably this is why I was placed on hold and disconnected. Further, the question that I asked, should not have required that XXXX place me on hold at all, considering on the previous day, I asked the same question inside a Compass branch, and the teller check the records in a matter of seconds. 
Regarding the issue of why I called. I visited your branch location at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX on XX/XX/2016 and made a {$200.00} cash deposit. My receipt is time stamped XXXX. I asked the teller to advise if there were any pending items or NSF items. He checked and advised separately that there were no pending items, nor recently returned items. 
I submitted an electronic check late XX/XX/2016 for {$1200.00}. On the morning of XX/XX/2016, when I realized other items had cleared overnight, I made a deposit to cover the outstanding check of {$1200.00}. Yet, there is a NSF Fee assessed on XX/XX/2016. I want documented proof of when the electric check in the amount of {$1200.00} was presented to Compass Bank for payment. Considering how long I have had an account, with direct deposit, with this company, the {$1100.00} balance, prior to the {$200.00} cash deposit, should have been sufficient to pay an item in the amount of {$1200.00}, without me having overdraft protection. I know that you could have assessed the fee and still paid the item. I recognize that Customer Service may not be your company 's focus. Perfectly, acceptable, as I can remove my direct deposit from your bank. However, I do want a document reflecting when my check was presented to Compass for payment.",,,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2148664

I currently have XXXX different loans with Navient. When I would have a payment of nearly {$1000.00} auto drafted out of my account to Navient to pay my loan I would constantly find myself receiving phone calls for past due and delinquent loans. Even though I was having my payment automatically drafted, Navient would constantly misapply that payment among my XXXX loans, despite us agreeing exactly how much I owe on each loan for each payment. Some loans would be overpaid and some loans would be underpaid. I would receive 5 or more harassing phone calls every single day about the underpaid loans because their system would show them as delinquent. I would have to call Navient to explain the situation, which would take anywhere from 45 minutes on the best day or up to 2 hours on a bad day. I would be transferred 3-4 times and often have the call "" disconnected '' and have to call back again and start the whole process over. On average, I would estimate my call would be "" disconnected '' about 30 % of the time and often after having being transferred multiple times and on the phone for over 30 minutes already. I would eventually be told that they would have to refer my issue to the finance reconciliation department so they could figure out what was wrong and fix it. In the mean-time I would still get harassing phone calls about being delinquent and be assessed late fees on the loans that were underpaid. After a month or two the finance department would "" fix '' my issue and reallocate my payments so that all loans were showing paid up to date. The problem is that while the finance department fixed my allocation on previous payments manually, the actual system that kept messing it up was never fixed. This led to my very next payment having the same exact issue and then once again I was showing over paid on some loans and underpaid on others. This would set off another chain reaction of harassing phone calls, late fees, and hours upon hours of my personal time stuck on the phone with them while they ineptly tried to figure out the problem. Even when I would explain to them that their system was messing it up and I knew exactly what the problem was because I had dealt with this before, it would still require a 90 minute phone call and several transfers. This occurred on and off for over 2 years and their constant removal of payments and reallocation of payments has made it completely impossible to accurately track my progress of payments on my loans online and ensure that my principle is being adequately reduced ... and I am a college educated XXXX. After years of poor management of payments, incorrect application of my payments, several hours wasted on the phone, etc ...

8/22/16,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MA,015XX,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"In XXXX, we filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. In the bankruptcy we listed a house which had an FHA loan on it. The loan was serviced by Countrywide, who was purchased by Bank of America. We did not want to keep the property. The bankruptcy was approved, and our debts were discharged on XXXX. 

Since that time, the lender has refused to take the title to the house. We have made many attempts to sign over the deed. I have many notes of telephone calls, etc. They were not returned. This past year we even hired an attorney to contact BOA to facilitate signing over the deed. Her calls were not returned either. 

We have been told by several banks that we are unable to refinance our current mortgage or obtain a new one until this house is out of our name. Worse, we have been told that if the bank takes it by foreclosure, it will appear on our credit report as a new foreclosure, just as if a new financial crisis occurred instead of dating it back to XXXX. 

We believe that this situation is fundamentally unjust. We had to file for a bankruptcy due to a total XXXX. We are trying to get the fresh start which the bankruptcy laws are designed to provide. We have been managing our financial affairs quite well in the over six years that have past. How is it that Bank of America can be allowed to crush our future? 

We suspect that the whole problem is the FHA mortgage. As we understand it, when a borrower defaults, the US government steps in to make the mortgage payments. This continues as long as the house remains titled to the borrower. If the bank takes it back and sells it, the bank only receives a portion of any loss from the government. We understand that banks might or might not be the ultimate bondholders of the GNMA pool containing the mortgage. However a servicing fee is paid to the the bank. What inventive does Bank of America have to take back the title? From where we stand, they have no incentive. 

An interesting contrast is found with the other property we listed. That was not insured by the government. The lender with that mortgage took the title immediately, and sold it. The entire matter was complete within six months of discharge. 

We are asking the CFPB to investigate why this is taken so long, especially given the heavy documentation of our willingness to sign the deed over. Further we want the CFPB to insist that our credit not be harmed any further",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2078066

10/22/15,"ONLINE Information Services, Inc.",TN,371XX,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Online Collections signed for and received a certified letter from me in which I explained to them that I was disputing the debt that they had placed on my credit report and was requesting validation and removal of the account due to reporting errors and the account being beyond the statute of limitations in the state of Arizona which is 3-6 years depending on debt type. I further requested something with my signature in order to prove that the account was even mine. The sent me a statement that only showed what they say I owed and that was pretty much it. The date of the account that they placed on my credit report was XX/XX/XXXX and the account was for electrical service from the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Arizona. My family moved out of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I called Online Collections on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with their Assistant Manager ( Ca n't remember his name ) and explained to him that I had moved out of AZ in XX/XX/XXXX and had requested that the electric and water be shut off at that time and that they would have owed me money from the deposit, not me owing them. I further explained to him that the account was reported as opened in XX/XX/XXXX which is a violation of the FCRA and FDCPA due to the account actually being from XX/XX/XXXX and the account needed to be removed immediately from my credit reports. He was rude and would not cooperate with helping me at all. I then filed a complaint with the XXXX ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX after speaking with and getting no assistance from their Assistant Manager. In the response on XX/XX/XXXX from the XXXX, they did not answer the complaint, only requested that I call and speak with their manager, XXXX XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and he was professional but refused to help even after I explained to him that the tradeline was reported incorrectly and in violation of the law as well as beyond the statute of limitations. I then explained to him that he was leaving me with little choice but to go ahead and file a lawsuit in order for this to be corrected. He then advised me that if that was what I wanted to do, OK. I then made contact with a consumer attorney in XXXX, AZ ( XXXX XXXX ). XXXX XXXX advised me that this would be a slam dunk, easy case to win. He then asked me if what I wanted was for the credit report to be fixed or if I wanted to win damages. I explained that all I really wanted was the account removed from my credit reports. He then recommended that I contact the XXXX due to me living in XXXX and the collection agency being located in North Carolina and the litigation would have to take place in AZ. He advised that it would cost me {$3500.00} - {$4000.00} in attorney 's fees in order to get this lawsuit filed and litigated. Then I would have to travel back and forth from AZ for the litigation and if all I wanted was the tradeline removed that the XXXX was what I should try first. I do not want Online Collections money ( it wouldnt hurt ) but I want this removed from my credit reports. I did not retain XXXX XXXX in lieu of attempting one last effort of resolving this issue without litigation. Please help me. 

I am attaching a copy of the original letter that I sent to online collections as well as the XXXX complaint.

However, as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the only assignment to the Security Deed at my County Clerk 's Office is from Wachovia to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. My complaint is that I have been unable to find the name of the Trust in which the Note is located, I do n't know who the real Note holder is, I do n't know who the real Security Deed holder is, and I am concerned that the assignment on file in my County Clerk 's Office is fraudulent. Please provide the following information. 
1. Full name of Trust where the Note Number is trading, or has traded, and the identifying Series of Certificates. ( Note : If the note number is being traded in a XXXX Trust or XXXX XXXX Trust, please provide all information to identify the Trust ( i.e. XXXX Pool Number, XXXX Number, XXXX or XXXX Trust Number and XXXX/XXXX ). When I type my address into the KnowYourOptions website, it is printed that it appears that XXXX Owns my loan and the mortgage company is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I know that that is not a Trust name. 
2. Full name, address, and telephone number of the Custodian of my original Promissory Note, including the name, address and telephone number of any trustee or other fiduciary. This request is being made pursuant to Section 1641 ( f ) ( 2 ) of the Truth In Lending Act. 
3. Full name, address, and telephone number of the Custodian of my original Security Instrument, including the name, address and telephone number of any trustee or other fiduciary. This request is being made pursuant to Section 1641 ( f ) ( 2 ) of the Truth In Lending Act. 
4. The physical location ( address ) of the original promissory note, original security instrument, and all assignments of the security instrument, and a contact name and phone number of someone who can arrange for inspection of said documents. 
5. Proof that the Assignment on file in the County Clerk 's Office is not fraudulent and verification that the XXXX Vice Presidents who signed the Assignment were employees of Wachovia Mortgage on that date. A copy of this Assignment is attached. The Assignment on file in The County Clerk 's Office in our county was dated by XXXX from XXXX XXXX, Florida in XX/XX/XXXX on the same day as our Meeting with Creditors in Federal Bankruptcy Court. However, XXXX did not file it until two months later in XX/XX/XXXX. I have read in research that XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX was a time period of fraud, robo-signing, and forged documents in the mortgage and foreclosure business practices. I want to make sure that this Assignment is authentic! 
Please answer the following questions : a. If XXXX owns the Note, what was the date that the company took ownership? 
b. If XXXX owns the Note, why is there no assignment on file in my County Clerk 's Office for the date of change of ownership of the Security Deed? 
c. Has the Promissory Note been separated from the Security Deed? 
d. Did Wells Fargo give XXXX Power of Attorney to service my loan, including carrying out foreclosure? 
e. Does Wells Fargo own the Note? 
f. Please note that I am not asking about the assignment dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX of servicing rights from Wells Fargo to XXXX attached in my supporting documents. What concerns me is that transfer was not accompanied by a new Assignment of the Security Deed from Wells Fargo to XXXX, XXXX, or to XXXX Trust. Where are those Assignments? 
g. Has the Original Promissory Note been lost? I have read in research about reckless mishandling and lost foundational loan documents in the merger from Wachovia to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX",Company chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1422726

12/15/15,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",SC,296XX,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My XXXX attempt to get my XXXX funds back from Bank of America. I was 21 days late in catching their error. They know it is fraud, but deny me a refund. This started when a BoA teller cashed my check that i did not give to anyone, I did not write it out, and I most certainly did not sign it. 


XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX Ref : Claim XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, My name is XXXX, and I am a XXXX year old single female that has been a Bank of America customer for over 37 years. My ex-husband and I started banking with what was then called XXXX and eventually became Bank of America. I have been a loyal customer since then. I am also what Bank of America refers to as a "" Preferred Customer ''. 

My claim started XX/XX/XXXX, and I have had a difficult time coming to grips with the result of part of the outcome since. I am an honest hard working person, and I believe in doing the right thing, but I do n't feel the right think was done unto me. 

I will try to make this short as I can. I had XXXX equity checks stolen from me XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$6000.00} of which {$3000.00} was returned back to me from Bank of America. Bank of America ( XXXX XXXX V.P. ) has refused, on more than one occasion, to reimburse me for Check number XXXX for {$3000.00}. I emailed XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX sincerely asking for her to reconsider. I waited for a while, but she never responded to my email. Sometime after this, I think XXXX, I contacted an old co-worker that is currently employed with Bank of America, XXXX. XXXX told me that the bank has a program in place to help bank customers. So XXXX put me in contact with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ext. XXXX ). 

XXXX contacted me, and I faxed her copes of my information. XXXX followed up with XXXX XXXX and the bank 's legal department, from what I understand, and again I was denied reimbursement. From XXXX, I was told that the bank ca n't catch everything, and I was 21 days late in catching "" THE BANKS ERROR ''. The banks error began when the bank teller cashed these checks and did not even question them or compare the signature to the one that is on file from me. XXXX also told me that there was no need in me trying to get my money back again, because I had taken this as far up as I could. I hate to admit it, but I was not very nice to XXXX after hearing this. This is just wrong. I felt, and still do, that I was stolen from once again. I even called the Solicitor 's Office here in XXXX. When I told the Solicitor my story ; I was asked which bank it was. When I said Bank of America, the comment I received was, "" I am not surprised ''. 

I was in one of Bank of America 's branches recently, and I was getting help from the bank 's VP. I was telling her about my situation and she suggested that I write you. She told me that you are a nice and understanding man. XXXX XXXX, I know the bank has its policies, but 21 days late in catching the banks error. These 21 days cost me {$3000.00} that XXXX XXXX knows was fraud, but she could care less because it is n't her loss. I am your average everyday person and {$3000.00} is a whole lot of money for me to just throw out the window. It is fraud, and it is wrong. I suppose this is why I am so persistent, because I believe in right and wrong. 

This is my last try, because you are as far as I can take this matter. 

XXXX XXXX, I sincerely ask that this be reconsidered because this just is n't right.

I had an exceptional leasing agent who explained to me why the application was declined. I had advised her I went through a few rough patches where I was always late but I was never evicted. She explained the company lists verified evictions. When I contacted the company they advised me to show proof that I was never evicted. Well it was hard to do because the property XXXX where I previously lived and where they claim the eviction came from has been demolished. I explained that to them and they advised me to contact the court. I contacted the court and they stated that I have never been evicted and they directed me to a site were I could print public records. I printed the records they showed all judgement as paid and resubmitted them to the reporting agency. Although they initially forwarded me to the court they again said the documentation was not enough. My argument is why should I have to prove I was never evicted? Is n't your job to only report accurate information that you have proof of? How can you report I was evicted if you do not have proof that I was? Its defamation, its inaccurate reporting, and it is costing me hundreds of dollars in useless application fees. I talked to the dispute department and he attempted to steer me away from disputing my file. Then I called again and another person was rude in his attempts as well but I forcefully advised him that I wanted the items disputed. I have contacted the company several times with no resolution. Although the dispute as not come back yet I feel that this company should only report information is verified and accurate.

I also faxed Netspend evidence. I have included my attachment evidence that I sent to Netspend in this complaint. The 1st email sent to XXXX stated I paid for a month of membership where I was told I would have all access to the XXXX including the pool & swimming lessons. I addressed in this email that 2 swim lessons had already been cancelled. The next email was XXXX admitting that these 2 lessons were cancelled and that I had paid in full for my membership. XXXX email went on to say that she would speak with her superior to see what she could do about the lesson that I paid for which I was being cheated because the XXXX cancelled it. As you can see from the emails, XXXX ignored me for almost 3 weeks, during this time, I was not being allowed to safely use the pool which again, was part of my Paid membership, because the lifeguards refused to do their job during pool hours. Most times there were No lifeguards when I was trying to practice. This is a service I Paid for that I was being denied a right to use. This means, I was also not allowed to use my paid membership. This is a direct violation of my consumer rights. As you can see from the next email evidence XXXX said she would not reimburse me for the cheated swim lesson and ... did not give me the courtesy of mentioning that I was also being denied on being able to use the membership that I had paid in full. I then contacted Netspend to be made whole. I also submitted to Netspend proof of all of my Paid In Full payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, Netspend denied my claim. I called in when I received this denial which was not until XX/XX/XXXX & requested a supervisor, I was transferred to a supervisor who told me her name was XXXX, XXXX hung up on me. Unacceptable. I then was transferred to a supervisor who told me her name is XXXX & that she was located in XXXX TX. I asked her why was my claim denied because I submitted evidence that I was cheated & that I was Not asking for a FULL refund, I was only asking for the amount I was CHEATED. I told XXXX I request an escalation to get a partial refund for only the services I was Cheated. XXXX admitted that she could Not find some evidence that I had already submitted. Outrageous. XXXX said she will start the appeal process for me.On XX/XX/XXXX, I had not heard anything on the appeal, so I called Netspend back & talked to a supervisor who told me her name was XXXX ( female ) and that she was in XXXX TX. XXXX advised me that NO appeal was ever submitted by XXXX. Further Outrageous. XXXX said she would forward my matter to corporate for appeal & resolution.Netspend corporate had been ignoring me since. Egregious. XXXX called me 1 time & because I am a working professional, I would not answer the 1 time they called. I have called & emailed corporate multiple times since & have been ignored. I have called to make very serious complaints to corporate. I 've provided attachment evidence on the emails I sent to corporate & I was ignored with my plea for help for very serious complaints. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Netspend again & talked to someone who said? .. her name was XXXX located in XXXX TX. I asked for a supervisor, I was denied that right put on & off hold for 30 minutes & then blind transferred to another CSR, Not a supervisor. I am currently still being Cheated.

I was taken directly to the emergency room, my mother was with me and told the doctor I am a veteran, I also had on the wristband from the VA hospital because I was on my way home before being in the accident. I never made it home, obviously. 
So months after the accident I received a call from a collection company about this bill. I told them they must have been mistaken because I was a passenger in the vehicle, and the insurance was supposed to pay the entire amount of the bill, I did not have a car at that time and did not, have auto insurance, nor did I have health insurance because I was not working so I was covered under the veteran medical coverage due to my low income. Normally if a veteran enters a civilian hospital with no insurance the civilian hospital is required to contact the nearest veteran hospital within XXXX hours from time of arrival to either make arrangements to have the veteran transported to the nearest VA facility or to inform the VA that they have XXXX of their patients so they can share the medical records and billing. This was not done when I was a patient at the hospital, in fact the hospital did not even send me a bill after the insurance paid them. It was months later ( at least 6 months ) that I got a call from the collection company. The following is a link from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs website "" XXXX 2001, the U.S. Congress provided VA with authorization ( called the Mill Bill ) to pay for emergency care in non-VA facilities for veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. The benefit will pay for emergency care rendered for non-service-connected conditions for enrolled veterans who have no other source of payment for the care. However, VA will only pay to the point of medical stability. There are very strict guidelines concerning these types of claims.

I also had no phone call about the issue. Seneca then increased my mortgage payment and my payment was on auto-pay at my bank so I did n't see it. Then Seneca began reporting me as not paying on time to credit reporting. They mailed money to my insurance company ( XXXX ) and when I got notice of that from Farmers, I called and said why did you do that I have and have always had homeowners. I again sent Seneca proof of homeowners that I had it and it had never lapsed. Seneca said that I had to get back the {$630.00} money Seneca sent to my insurer. I did that and mailed the money to Seneca but to their "" insurance processing '' address that Seneca gave me. I did that, AND I sent in {$690.00} in an autopayment to the mortgage payment side of Seneca to get them to stop showing me as owning them more money - I made many phone calls and they never seemed to know how to fix it. Last month they sent me {$720.00} back that they said they got from "" their insurer '' ( when I asked them what happened to the rest if the money - {$500.00} that I mailed to the "" insurance processor '' Seneca agents told me they did n't know what I was talking about. After they said I would be getting a {$720.00} payment back in the mail ( a check which they did send ), I asked what about the rest of the money - Seneca said I would get a {$320.00} credit off my mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX - said "" are you sure '' and they said "" yes ''. [ Never mind that by my accounting they still owed me approximately {$500.00} which was unaccounted for in the combination of the XXXX payments I sent them - {$630.00} and {$690.00} ]. So in XX/XX/XXXX I sent {$1800.00} on my {$2000.00} mortgage for XX/XX/XXXX [ At this point Seneca told me the "" escrow '' was now off my mortgage ]. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX they called and left me messages saying my mortgage payment was late again - I did n't get those calls until XX/XX/XXXX as I was traveling for work. I call them again today and they said that somehow there was "" money I had to pay for the insurance '' so my only credit was {$320.00} which was "" a part of the {$720.00} we sent you. '' So you have to pay {$270.00} more over the phone now. They said "" sorry '' but the {$720.00} was all we owed you back and we sent you that check. When I said "" you told me I would get a {$320.00} credit '' they said "" oh no one could have told you that. '' When I said where did the total money I sent in go to, they said "" oh probably to pay for insurance. '' I said, "" but I have insurance. '' They said, oh well "" we had to pay for insurance. '' So, I just had to pay them {$270.00} more over the phone. I asked "" did your report me late on my credit report again '' they said "" yes '' and I said can you put notes in the record that this was not my fault or give me a letter saying to - they said "" no - you have to wait 60 days for it all to get cleared up.

Chase has done this about 4 times in the last year to our family. Each time they backed off and reversed the fees, but not after I had to call and then get elevated to a supervisor. The latest incident happened last night. My account balance as of XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16 was {$28.00}. My wife had a payroll deposit today on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$440.00}. All should be good then, but not with Chase. They took a check for {$120.00} and backdated to XX/XX/XXXX. They covered the check, but charged me another {$34.00} in "" NSF FEES ''. This is flat out wrong and many more households are paying the price of bank greed and policies designed to hurt the lower/middle class. Why did n't Chase bounce the check as there was only {$28.00} in the account? I 'm disappointed that these big banks are still targeting the lower/middle class with fees. I 'm asking your agency to stop the practice of 'back-dating '' checks by 1 day as a bank policy. This practice does n't hurt their large depositors in any way, but for the majority of us it does. I would be surprised if "" Fee Income '' has n't doubled or tripled in the last 10 years as banks make it a point of many internal discussions on ways to increase revenue and "" Fee Income '' is always at the top of the list.

I have been making payment on this loan for 15 years ( less a few early periods of forbearance and an unemployment forbearance ). I logged in recently to see how much my remaining balance was and was shocked to see that I am after 15 years of payments listed as now owing Navient {$38000.00} in student loans. I have called and spoken with their customer service department asking how this can be the case on a 6 % loan I have been paying for 15 years on, they explained that during my forbearance periods interest was accrued and that for a time I was on an interest only repayment plan. My math still does not add up on how these amounts could lead to such a massive increase in the loan amount. I inquired on how we could get the loan paid in a timely fashion and the best offer they could give me was that I could pay $ XXXX/month for for 170 more months - which would be another {$55000.00} in addition to the 15 years of payment already made - which would be something like four times the amount of the original loan in total. 

I suspect something may have been added to my account or misfiled ( late fees, misapplied payments, etc ). Also, if I had been aware I would be accruing interest during forbearance or that I was paying an interest-only repayment plan ( and with that, if I was, how could I have been accruing interest as they claim ) I would never have agreed to those terms.

7/3/15,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,CA,956XX,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I have XXXX complaints about USAA mortgage services. The first, I 'm concerned that I may have overpaid in interest. The second has to do with how USAA unilaterally applies additional mortgage payments to principal, interest and escrow, and the third has to do with their use of "" mortgage servicers '' to manage their mortgages and their lack of accountability or responsibility to their members when using the "" mortgage servicers. "" For the first issue, I sent three additional mortgage payments that were to be applied to the principal only. In each instance USAA applied the additional payment to the principal, interest and escrow. I contacted USAA to correct the payments, with the exception of the last payment. I have n't yet been able to reach the "" mortgage servicer. '' As interest is determined by the value of the loan, the interest rate and number of days, I 'm concerned that I 've overpaid in interest. I was assured by USAA that the payment corrections would be dated back to the date the money was received ; however, it does n't appear that the corrections were. The first payment was made XXXX/XXXX/15, but was not corrected until XXXX/XXXX/15. The second payment was made XXXX/XXXX/15, but the correction was not made until XXXX/XXXX/15. Unfortunately, because of my work schedule and USAA 's "" mortgage servicer '' business hours, I 've not yet been able to reach them to correct the third payment. 
Additionally, the second issue, on the third payment, I made it very clear that the payment was to be applied to the principal only. I wrote in all caps and highlighted "" PRINCIPAL ONLY '' on the check and money orders.

On XXXX/XXXX/2015 after receiving no payment from Barclay Bank USA, I contacted Barclay bank again, was told that the case number assigned to the call I made on XXXX/XXXX/15 had been closed because Barclay Bank USA was unable to issue a refund to XXXX XXXX XXXX because the original payment had been made through a "" XXXX party ''. I asked why they did not inform me of this and got no answer. I questioned who the "" 3rd Party '' was and they could not tell me. I got the agent from Barclay Bank USA to conference in XXXX XXXX XXXX online payment department, and the agent from XXXX XXXX confirmed that they use a "" 3rd Party '' to process their transactions and recommended that Barclay Bank USA just issue us a manual check for the credit balance on our account, which the Barclay agent agreed to do.

She also mentioned that we could monitor our account online and that when we saw our credit balance return to XXXX, we 'd know the transaction had processed. She also assigned a new case number to the transaction.

3/25/15,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,941XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"I wrote a check in the amount of {$1500.00} to a business ( with a business name ) in XXXX Texas on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The check was stolen and deposited into someone 's personal account at XXXX XXXX. It was not endorsed by the payee but instead signed by an individual. Yet Chase bank ( my bank and the payee 's bank ) honored the check anyway, took the money from my account, and paid the individual that was not the payee. 

I learned of this the following day and notified Chase bank. They required me to fill out and submit an affidavit. Which I did immediately. Months passed and I followed up every week, then In XXXX XXXX Chase requested and affidavit from the Payee. That was done immediately. 

Since then I have gotten the runaround, and still my money has not been returned. I have supported their efforts to find the thief, yet more than 5 months have passed and Chase refuses to return my money until they get the money back from the thief, even though they paid the thief, someone other than the payee. I have no control over that. There was no fraud on my end. No one claimed to be me, nor did they claim to be the payee. The check was stolen and Chase paid it without verifying they were the payee. This is their mistake, not mine. 

I have called the Chase fraud department almost every week trying to come to a resolution, and they have no news or updates. For months they tell me they are researching this. 

Moreover, they have been rude and even threatened to hang up when I ask for a manager. 
I feel I have no recourse to get my money back other than to sue Chase ( which I really do not want to do ). And so two weeks ago I told Chase that I feel the only way I will ever see my money again is to sue them. 

The next day I got a call from my bank manager saying that Chase fraud department told her that they are closing the claim because I threatened to sue them. 

How can they do that? 

Last week I called Chase 's Executive office and they said they 'd resolve this in 48 hours. Since then they have not called me back. I have called there two more times and I was told that someone would call me back that day, but no one has yet to call me. 
I realize that I really do have to go to court to get my money back. This is not right because they should not have paid someone other than the payee. 

I am also reaching out to you in the hope that there 's an easier way than court and also to find out of there is any other way for me to resolve this.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1300629

FIRST FEDERAL CREDIT & COLLECTION failed to investigate, verify, or validate said debt.

11/21/16,TOYOTA MOTOR CREDIT CORPORATION,CA,956XX,Consumer Loan,Vehicle lease,Managing the loan or lease,,"I am writing to file a complaint against Toyota Financial Services. My father leased a Toyota Corolla on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. After being diagnosed with a XXXX in late XXXX XXXX, he passed away on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. His condition had developed slowly over a few months and our family was unaware that he was falling behind in his finances due to mental confusion. 

After he had passed away, I received a notice by mail that the Toyota lease payments had fallen behind. I attempted to make a payment with cash via XXXX XXXX but they were unable to make the payment. So I made the payment through Billpay instead. My financial institution cut and mailed a physical check in the amount of {$390.00}. The check was issued on XXXX and cleared on XXXX. 

XXXX Leasing repossessed the vehicle on XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the early morning XXXX working in conjunction with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I made phone calls to Toyota Financial Services company on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I followed all of their requests to make payments to catch up and cover all of the fees. 

I faxed all documents they requested including a Death Certificate and Certification of Trust. 

On XXXX, XXXX, a representative in the Redemptions department explained the timeline that the car will be auctioned off on XXXX but if I paid all of the fees for the repossession of the vehicle, transport, late fees, daily storage fee, personal property fee, then they would release the vehicle to me as trustee of my father 's trust. 

I made the following payments as requested : {$390.00} via Billpay ( check cleared on XXXX ) {$760.00} via XXXX XXXX {$490.00} via phone payment with a Toyota rep ( Filed an EFT dispute on XXXX after learning payment was never credited ) {$440.00} via XXXX XXXX on XXXX I scheduled an appointment with XXXX XXXX XXXX, a car auction company in XXXX California and paid {$60.00} for a money order to pay storage fees. 

I obtained a Repossession Release Form from the XXXX XXXX Police Department. 

After following all of the steps provided by representatives at Toyota Financial Services including XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, I was informed on XXXX by XXXX that the vehicle could only be released to the accountholder, who is deceased. 

I am the trustee of my father 's trust. I have the fiduciary role of managing all assets and property in my father 's estate. I also made the case that Toyota is better off maintaining the existing lease agreement rather having to the auction the car. 

I asked XXXX to escalate the call. He asked me to hold while he talked to his manager XXXX. After waiting on hold for 20 minutes, he said she was too busy to talk. She would call me back. 

As of XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, I have not received a call back from the XXXX, a manager in the Redemptions Department of Toyota Financial Services. 

Here 's my request for Toyota : Return the vehicle to me as trustee for my father 's trust. The lease is for 3 years. As of XXXX, there will only be 2 years left on lease. I will continue to make the payments for the remainder of the lease. At the end of 3 years, I will return the vehicle as specified in the lease agreement. That is win-win for Toyota Financial and for my father 's trust. 

It seems like a fair request. 

Please help me to resolve this matter. 

I will attach documents as listed below including my detailed complaint including a detailed account of all calls made to Toyota Financial Services. 

Thank you.

9/23/15,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MN,554XX,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Inadequate help over the phone,"I was shopping around for a mortgage refinance XX/XX/2015. I asked XXXX lenders to pull my credit and provide me with my refinance options. I did this within 30 days of each other. 
Eight months, I logged into my XXXX account and my credit had gone from XXXX to XXXX -- nearly XXXX points. This was the only potentially adverse instance on my credit report. I had no other credit inquiries, late payments or varying credit usages. 
I should be protected and able to shop around for credit products. My main question is what is the mechanism for protecting consumers? Is it the ability for lenders to REMOVE hard inquiries? Or is it the ability of the credit bureaus to NOT allow multiple inquiries to adversely affect my score? 
I talked to XXXX and they said I had to talk to the Credit Bureaus. "" We have nothing to do with my score -- only the inquiries. "" I then talked to Equifax on the phone and they said "" You have to get the LENDERS to remove the hard inquiries. '' Even after reading the below passage verbatim to the Equifax manager, he still said that I have to get the lender to remove it. 

"" Can shopping for a loan have an effect on my credit? 
UPDATED XX/XX/XXXXHere 's the bottom line : Any change to your credit score from shopping will be a minor price to pay for getting the best deal on a car, mortgage, or student loan. If you have a great credit history, shopping around may have no impact on your credit score at all. And even if your credit history is less than stellar, the impact from shopping around for a loan is likely to shave off between XXXX points. On a typical credit score of around XXXX that 's not likely to affect you much, especially when you compare that to the XXXX dollars you could save by finding a better interest rate on a loan. 
For specific types of loans -- auto, mortgage, and student loans - credit scoring models are also designed to take shopping for a loan into account. Let 's say you are looking around for an auto loan and you authorize XXXX lenders to check your credit score. All those credit checks -- the industry calls them "" inquiries '' - should either count as XXXX inquiry, if the inquiries are made in a short period such as fourteen days. If you shop for a mortgage loan at the same time you are shopping for an auto loan, the shopping you do for those XXXX loans should count as XXXX inquiries. 
Tip : When you apply for a loan and the lender checks your credit, a credit score is created for the lender. According to XXXX major credit scoring company, any inquiries that took place in the 30 days prior to that scoring will not affect your credit score. So it 's a good idea to do your loan shopping in a timely manner. 
The rules on inquiries are different if you are applying for new credit cards. Credit scoring companies consider consumers who apply for several new credit lines in a short period of time to be a higher risk and they adjust credit scores accordingly. "" I THEN spoke to the CFPB and they were completely unable to help explain how I was ACTUALLY PROTECTED or what I should do in order to raise my score. Again, do I push for the lender to REMOVE the inquiries? Or do I push the credit bureaus to count them only as XXXX INQUIRY? All they said was that I could sue if I needed to!",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1577027

The escrow shortage has made my monthly mortgage payment increase over $ XXXX/month. I closed on the home only 6 months ago and the taxes, mortgage insurance, and homeowners insurance are all the same as when they were a few months ago when I closed on the home.I discovered on my annual escrow statement, Flagstar has the incorrect insurance premium amount being calculated for escrow ( approx. double what my actual insurance premium is ) My insurance premium was paid in full when I closed on the home.

3/11/17,DISCOVER BANK,CA,916XX,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"To Whom It May Concern, On XXXX of last year ( XXXX ), my wife have ordered a XXXX from XXXX using our Discover credit card. When the product was delivered to our home, we found that the merchant has sent us a product that is completely far from the item that we have paid for. We then called the merchant right away to notify them of this discrepancy but no resolution was put into place as the merchant refused to send us the right item or refund us back our money as they claim the circumstances to be impossible. Devastated on the outcomes of our conversations with the merchant, we then contacted our issuing bank, Discover Bank on XX/XX/XXXX to seek for help and initiate a dispute against a charge of {$3800.00} from XXXX. The dispute process took nearly 6 months as Discover bank kept siding with the merchant AFTER my wife and I have provided them with all of the documentations they asked. In that span of time, we had to contact them multiple times to re-open the case and have also provided them with more compelling evidence for them to even re-consider their decision after they would close their investigation in the merchants favor. Our chargeback dispute was denied three times even though the evidence and documentation we have given them are far more substantial than what the merchant, XXXX have provided them. Also, on XX/XX/XXXX, when we provided more evidence to re-open the case for a FINAL dispute, we were told and promised by the MANY discover bank representatives that we will be getting a final decision within 15 days from that day. Now, two months later after not hearing back from them, we received a notification that states that we are liable to pay for the full amount as they ( discover bank ), find the merchant to be correct. This ongoing unfair practice that Discover bank has been doing to us have caused us to close our account with them after being their loyal customer for 6 years. As of now, both my wife and I feel discriminated and violated of our consumer rights and all we want is justice that I believe we are entitled to. 
Dealing with this corporate greed and new form of "" evilness '' I did n't know existed made me do my own research online and I have found many others, just like my wife and I to be a victim of Discover banks unruly practices. Not only are they biased of their decisions ( they ALWAYS side with the merchant ) but they also do not practice their own rules and regulations. As when I researched their chargeback dispute guidelines, it clearly stated that, customers MUST obtain a decision within 15 calendar days during the final review. But clearly, that was not the case for us, as 2 months and 2 billing cycles passed and here we are getting hit by the money we have to pay back for the item we did not even get to see nor enjoy. 
This is indeed very hard for us as we no longer know any other recourse to fight this chargeback anymore and we wish that no other honest consumers will have to go through this XXXX we are going through. If there is anything consumer advocates out there could do, it is to spend some time to review the unfair practices Discover bank is doing to their customers.

I called the closing law office immediately and was told by them to contact the mortgage company. I was also told that I am not responsible for any fines and/or penalties for the late payment of the tax bill. On XXXX XXXX I spoke with XXXX in the Tax department at SunTrust.

This effects me by 1 ) having a past due tax bill which could allow for a lien to be put on my house and possible foreclosure action started and 2 ) by not paying the tax bill on time I am not able to deduct it from my XX/XX/XXXX federal and state individual tax return which will make me have a higher tax liability because the tax was not paid in XX/XX/XXXX.

This company still have a bankruptcy showing on my file from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which i clearly told them are not mine and I included that in my first complaint along with my FTC fraud affidavits that are notarized and signed by law enforcement in front of witnesses so that should tell you all you need to know. I have attached a copy of my FTC affidavit one more time so that this company can finally block these XXXX public records permanently off my file as it states in the FCRA laws that all fraudulent information should be blocked within 5 business days. I 'm in the process of getting a mortgage for my family and this is hindering the process especially with all the identity theft i have been through i just want to finally live a normal life or try to get back to it. I called and requested a supervisor in the fraud department and they told me someone would call me back in 24 hours and i never got a call. These people do n't care about anyone but themselves but I have a family to support and feed and my credit is a very major priority to doing that and keeping my good job. So I asked for the last time to please remove the US bankruptcy from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from my file permanently they are not mine and is due to fraud and identity theft. If the company does n't comply with FCRA Section 605b which states. ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of -- ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. 
( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section -- ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. 
( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. 
( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that -- ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. 
( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. 
( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block I asked the CFPBtake civil action",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,2069887

8/26/16,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,WA,981XX,Credit card,,Advertising and marketing,,"I have never applied for card with monthly APR for purchases in my entire life. XX/XX/2016 I began looking for credit cards with 0 % APR for purchases and 0 % APR for balance transfers. I found this website, which I believed to be Barclays card offering for such a card : XXXX. 
I reviewed the terms and conditions for the XXXX XXXX card and found them acceptable. I accepted the terms and conditions, and saved them to my computer. I then began filling out the credit card application with my personal information on the XXXX website. I lost Internet access to the site in the middle of the application process and refreshed the web page. The refresh returned me to the XXXX where I had to start the application process all over. I selected what I thought to be the Cash Forward Card again, and clicked through the prompts until I had to enter my personal information again. I entered the required PII, submitted the application, and was accepted for a credit card for what I thought was a card with 0 % APR on purchases for the first 12 months. 
The card arrived in the mail a few weeks later in XX/XX/XXXX upon which time I called into Barclaycard customer service to confirm the terms and conditions. My primary concern was that the card offered 0 % APR on purchases. The customer service manager confirmed that I had a card with 0 % APR on purchases telling me that I would not be charged interest for any purchases for 12 months. He also advised me that the call was recorded. I proceeded to make purchases for nearly {$11000.00} over the course of the next few months. 
When I received the first credit card statement in mid-JuIy, I noticed that there was interest charged. I called Barclaycard customer service to inquire about the interest charge and they informed me that I had signed up for a card called the Arrival card, which only provides 0 % APR for balance transfers and not for purchases. 
I informed the manager, and numerous managers since on the phone that I did not sign up for the Arrival card, but rather the Cash Forward card with 0 % APR on purchases. I also told them of the previous call to the manager directly after I received the card and how he confirmed I had the card with no APR for the first 12 months. This second manager, ( ID XXXX ) told me that Barclaycard did not offer a card like that. If I could show him either an advertisement or terms and conditions with both 0 % APR for purchases and balance transfers then he would personally change my card to the card I believed I was selecting when I first began the process of applying for the Cash Forward. I promptly sent him screen shots of advertisement for the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the terms and conditions for it. He lied! 
While researching Barclaycard offers I also noticed that the Arrival card ( the card Barclay issued to me w/o my consent ) had an advertisement in bold print saying "" Purchase and Balance Transfer Rate 0 % APR for 12 months, '' essentially promising the same exact terms and conditions as the XXXX Card so I sent him the screen shot of that also. 
I have also had conversations with another manager ( ID XXXX ). She told me that Barclaycard would honor its advertisements and switch me over to the card I requested. Barclaycard has not done this to date. 
Barclaycard has falsely advertised to me in order to trap me into paying interest on a card for which I did not willingly apply. 
Barclaycard has fraudulently opened a credit card in my name and has refused to change the card type to the type I requested from them. 
I have had to open other credit cards in order to transfer the Barclay balance thus tarnishing my credit. 
I request that your office investigate Barclay card for fraudulently advertising, deceptive enrollment practices.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Servicemember,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2082091

Beginning in XXXX, my payments of {$1300.00} were not reflected on my next statement. This happened for four consecutive months, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX, with a total of {$5500.00} missing. After speaking with them by phone, I faxed copies of each online payment transaction with transaction number, and my WF account number written on each. I delayed making a XXXX payment until they could track down the payments. 
Their response was to completely ignore my proof of payments, sending instead a XXXX page packet telling me how they could help me catch up on payments. Included in that was an application for mortgage assistance. No mention was made of my fax or the proof of payment. 
Wells Fargo advanced me money against the amount of escrow in my house to help pay the taxes on my house for two years. Illness and the recession had decimated me financially. I had originally asked for an escrow account, but was told it was not possible with that type of loan. After the difficulties with the taxes, they started an escrow account, which nearly doubled my payments ; I was ok with this. However, they wanted XXXX retroactive payments, each {$1300.00} ( approx ). I was able to scrape together XXXX, but not a second XXXX. After several phone calls, I was finally connected with a woman who worked with me on the phone for nearly an hour ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). Going back and forth for okays, a plan was implemented for the remaining amount ( {$1300.00} ) to be paid over a 48-month period, as part of my monthly payment. It went exactly as planned, until the end of XXXX, the first quarter. Their computer kicked out the agreement, and I was told they had no record of it. That has been an ongoing issue. 
Adding to this problem is the policy WF has concerning signed contracts - once signed, you are never allowed to talk to anyone face to face about any problems. You can not go to their mortgage finance building and speak to anyone. All must be done by phone. In the past XXXX six years, I have been given fake names and phone numbers, which means that I have never been able to talk to the same person twice.

Today XXXX/XXXX/16 I was reviewing my statements for the last few months and noticed that this has not been the case so I called Chase again. 
I spoke to a XXXX in their XXXX XXXX TX call center who told me again that payments are in fact credited to the balance with the highest interest rate.. When I told her that based on the information on my statement this was not the case so she then told me that any payment I make first is credited to my oldest promotion balance and the remaining funds to my balance with the highest interest rate. 

this again proved to be wrong based on what I have on my monthly statement. 
XXXX had me on the phone for over 45 minutes and finally transferred me to her supervisor XXXX who also could not answer my question. By then I was on the phone for an hour asking that someone tell me the breakdown of how my payments have been applied but neither XXXX or her supervisor could figure this out looking at various screens on their computer. My question is if Chase employees ca n't figure this out how an average consumer could ever be able to see where their money is being applied to. I asked XXXX to formally log my complaint as I was expecting someone at Chase could get the answer to may question and call me back but I was told that she will log the complaint but that no one at Chase would call me back as they do n't reply to the complaints filed-this just makes no sense-why log a complaint if you are not going to do anything about it. 
I now feel that Chase has been taking my money and applying the payments any way they choose -probably to my lower interest balance so that they can maximize their interest income while causing me, the consumer to overpay interest Their statements are certainly not consumer friendly to allow me in seeing how every dollar I pay is being applied.

Our original loan was a principal/interest loan, when it was sold ( previously to XXXX ) it changed to include an escrow account. 2 mortgage companies later, we are at Nationstar Mortgage. Last XXXX, we were hit with an unusually high electric bill as well as having an accident in our RV. I fell behind 2 months on our payments. We tried to modify. On our 3rd trial payment, I realized that our 2nd trial payment was returned. So, I tried to reapply at their suggestion. These 3 trial payments were put to the back end of our loan, not the past due months, therefore by this time, it looked like e ere 4 months behind. In the meantime, they decided that we "" make too much money '' and could therefore afford our original payments and denied the 2nd application. By the time we got things figured out, they required me to make 9 of said-12 late payments, draining our entire savings. I think this should have caught us up but it did n't. Anyway, I kept us at 2 months behind by continuing to make a payment each month since I could not afford to pay extra to catch up, hoping to catch up with my husband 's XXXX bonus.

10/15/16,Controlled Credit Corporation,OH,451XX,Debt collection,Medical,Communication tactics,Used obscene/profane/abusive language,"Hi, I recently had a medical bill from XXXX Hospital get turned over to a collection agency, Controlled Credit Corporation ( CCC ). Within 90 days I set-up a payment arrangement of $ XXXX/month to be paid the last day of each month with CCC. 

I originally contacted XXXX Hospital because I wanted to make my payments directly to XXXX Hospital and a billing representative told me that I could do that but I just needed to let CCC know to "" send the bill back. '' I have been on phone calls numerous times with both XXXX Hospital 's billing office and "" XXXX '' with CCC on three-way calls and individual calls to get my bill sent back to XXXX Hospital. "" XXXX '' says that there is no way once the bill is sent to CCC for CCC to then be able to "" send it back '' to the original creditor. 

I expressed my concerns with "" XXXX '' that if I make my payments towards the bill which was almost {$500.00} that XXXX Hospital may not ever know I 'm making these payments and then XXXX Hospital will assume I am not paying the bill and they will put this on my credit report. 

"" XXXX '' assured me that CCC will be reporting back to XXXX Hospital every time I make a payment. I made a payment to CCC on XXXX/XXXX/16 in the amount of {$50.00} and I recently received a bill from XXXX Hospital for {$470.00}, however, my new balance is {$420.00}. 

I called yesterday "" again '' and spoke to a representative from XXXX Hospital 's billing office ( XXXX ) and asked him to do a three-way call with me to CCC and figure-out why these XXXX entities are not communicating with one another about the payment plan I have set-up and the payments I have been making. 

"" XXXX '' originally refused to do a three-way phone call with me until I insisted that I speak with his supervisor. He told me "" that 's now how we do things around here. '' I said, "" well, I did a three-way call with a representative from XXXX Hospital 's billing office and "" XXXX '' at CCC a few weeks ago. Eventually, after keeping me on hold XXXX obliged to do a three-way phone call. 

My main complaint is that XXXX Hospital and CCC are not communicating with one another about the payments I have been making. XXXX from CCC said it is because XXXX 's billing office is not the accounting office, but that the accounting office at XXXX is aware of me making these payments. 

I do not feel confident in this because I still continue to get bills from XXXX Hospital. Why am I getting bills from XXXX Hospital if CCC is handling the collection of this debt? Why is n't CCC reporting back to XXXX Hospital in a timely manner about the payments I am making on the account so XXXX can then update my account with a new lower balance? 

All the while, XXXX at CCC is not answering solidly the questions I have for him. At one point he said, "" what do you want me to do, tell you how we run our business? "". I told XXXX, "" no, but I expect you to communicate back to XXXX Hospital in a timely manner when I make payments on my account so they are well-informed of me doing so! '' XXXX keeps telling me that "" they deal with thousands of customers on a daily basis and that he is trying to get this resolved but he ca n't answer these questions for me and I should n't be receiving any bills from XXXX Hospital. '' He assures me that CCC nor XXXX Hospital will not put this on my credit report.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2162172

11/25/15,"QUICKEN LOANS, INC.",UT,841XX,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I was in the process of re financing my home, I was working with a few different mortgage companies trying to find the best deal. XXXX of these companies was quicken loans. I made a decision to go with a local company but the banker I was dealing with at quicken loans using their aggressive tactics told me "" the rates went up this morning but lucky for you I locked you in already. '' Not knowing everything about mortgages like most people, He made me feel like I was already stuck and I had to go with him. So I went ahead and filled out the mortgage application and within minutes they had my credit card info and charged me a {$500.00} deposit for the appraisal and credit info. I felt this was quite quick but knew It was part of it so it was fine.. 
I was rubbed the wrong way from the very beginning and felt uncomfortable using this company, so I asked around and also the lender I wanted to work with and found out I can back out and cancel the loan and if I did it soon enough I could get all my {$500.00} back. So this is what I did, I called Monday morning the XXXX of XXXX and cancelled my loan. I told the banker I want to stay on the phone until it 's 100 % finished. He then told me it 's done. There is nothing more you need to do. I then asked him to transfer me to the right person to talk to about getting my refund to my credit card. As I spoke to the woman in that department she told me everything was final and it would take 7-10 business days and I would see my refund. So I waited until Friday XXXX XXXX and never saw my refund, so I called to find out what was going on. A lady in customer car looked up my info and said you 'll see it on Monday and to call again if it 's not there.. Monday comes, no refund. So today, Tuesday morning the XXXX of XXXX I called again to find out what 's going on. I get another lady in customer care, as she looks up my account she tells me they have n't even started the canceling process, and this process will take their team 8 days to complete and then the refund will come 7-10 business days from that. It has been 15 days and I will not receive my {$500.00} refund from a multi-billion dollar company for at least another 2-3 weeks! 5 weeks in total is completely unacceptable. It 's a credit card, very easy to refund a charge.. 
The high pressure, plus using tactics to make me feel trapped just to take my money as fast as possible and then give me the run around and hold my money hostage for as long as possible so they can make more money is downright disgraceful and I am absolutely disgusted with this company.

They were unable to validate my debt, but they reported the charge off delinquency in XX/XX/XXXX. I brought this to their attention, and they stated there was nothing they could do. 
I contacted all XXXX major credit bureau 's immediately and filed official disputes, requesting removal due to : -Reporting of misinformation -Unable to validate debt I also sent OneMain a certified letter via USPS, with the same request. I included copies of my credit report, which ( OneMain is reporting ) shows the bad information. The dates they report, along with the amounts not only are incorrect, but do not come remotely close mathematically, which proves the errors. 

In goodwill, I have requested validation, and removal on multiple occasions, via Fax, email, certified mail, in-person, as well as phone. I was recently contacted by the executive office in regards to the complaint I filed with the Better Business Bureau, but have yet to receive any response to my requests. 

I am now filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, because it is clear that OneMain is actually aging my account in order to prolong reporting to the credit agencies. I did advise them that I am a resident of Oregon, and the statue of limitations on debt is six years, as well as the requirement to report correct information, validate debt when asked, comply with regulated debt collection practices, and remove all negative information after seven years.",,Servicemember,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2334069

I also can not transfer it to a lower interest rate. I am currently paying 6.75 % interest. In the past, I have called for different payment options to pay it off faster and they directed me to the graduated plan. I recently called for loan forgiveness and AES said that I have to pay {$250.00} for the next 11 years and that is their loan forgiveness program. I have already been paying for 11 years.

7/3/15,"CITIBANK, N.A.",GA,301XX,Credit card,,Credit card protection / Debt protection,,"I signed up for a Best Buy credit card ( probably ) 5 years ago. The bank no longer possesses records before XX/XX/XXXX so I have no official way of knowing. At the time I signed up for this credit card, there was never any mention of a debt protection service, nor was I ever charged a monthly fee for my first few purchases. When I purchased a new refrigerator in XX/XX/XXXX, it appears that somehow this service has been added to my account and I was never notified. Due to consistently utilizing an automatic payment system through Best Buys website ( which estimates how much I need to pay monthly in order to pay off my purchase within the 0 % interest time frame ), I never noticed the monthly additional charges of this unwanted service until now. I have requested my oldest statement be delivered to me ( from XX/XX/XXXX ) so that I can attempt to add up the total value of this fraudulent service 's charges. For XX/XX/XXXX the total amount I was charged was {$320.00} and so far for XX/XX/XXXX I have been charged {$190.00}. I assume that I was also charged XXXX {$100.00} for the 3 months of my purchase in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted them at XXXX regarding being signed up for a service I never requested nor never have previously. I was informed over the phone that the service is now cancelled and that I would be mailed some information within the next 2 weeks regarding a potential refund. 

I have browsed numerous results on XXXX for the exact same issues, but most of the issues dated back to when XXXX was in control of the account. I also discovered that the debt protection service was discontinued with the cards roughly 1-2 years ago. I am very upset that somehow after the service was discontinued ( after the class action lawsuit, which I was completely unaware of ) that it was somehow set up for my account. Also, I have noticed that the amount I am charged each month for the debt protection service, that I did not sign up for, has increased steadily over the duration of my 0 % interest purchase. The oldest statement I have access to through their web service ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows the monthly charge for the debt protection service as {$27.00} and the charge for the debt protection service on XX/XX/XXXX is {$34.00}. 

Due to this entire situation, I am at least behind {$520.00} due to fraudulent activity by my lender ( ) and am very upset that I did not catch this much sooner.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1450770

9/27/15,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",TN,379XX,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"In XX/XX/XXXX and into XX/XX/XXXX we experienced a substantial drop in household income which led us to fall behind on our mortgage payments. In an effort to save our home and prevent foreclosure we began working with Bank of America to see what programs we might be eligible for. 

Over the course of the following 6 years we tried several times to bring our loan current with Bank of America. There were work-outs and different types of modifications ( including HAMP ) and each time we neared the end of the process as explained to us something would "" happen '' and we did not complete the program : often times after being told by a Customer Relationship Manager ( CRM ) that we had reached the end and our loan was going to be modified. On at least two instances we were told our file was "" going to the courthouse '' for the paperwork to be filed within a week ( one time we were told our paperwork WAS taken and entered at the courthouse ). The CRM told us we should be receiving information explaining how to make payments or set up auto-payment in the next couple of weeks. Instead, two weeks later we received a letter stating we had voluntarily removed ourselves from the program. Appealing and escalating to find out what happened took the next 8 months, and we still have never been given the same answer twice. 

After filing bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX we anticipated losing our home, but after the bankruptcy passed and we still had our home we again started the process of attempting to modify our loan. Again the process was wrought with issues that were just hard to explain. Documents were not processed timely, notary signatures were rejected ( even after going to a Bank of America branch location to have the notary services performed ), underwriter review was inconsistent and it took 7 months to navigate completely through the program and ( finally ) reach a successful modification. 

While preparing our home for sale a title search turned up XXXX liens placed against our deed from HUD. This was a surprise to us, as we had never successfully completed a modification plan. After putting all the pieces together we discovered these were from the earliest of our unsuccessful attempts to modify our home loan. We have met with nothing but resistance to adequately investigate these fraudulent liens from Bank of America while being told by managers and CRM 's along the way that they see the issue and they are going to "" escalate '' our problem. 

The facts are plain : our interest rate remained unchanged from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, as no modification took place. Prior to the successful modification in XXXX XXXX our past due amount was around {$35000.00} ... an amount that is mathematically impossible if the XXXX lien amounts from HUD ( totaling over {$15000.00} ) were ever applied to our account. The XXXX liens were entered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which again is impossible as there is only 14 days between the XXXX dates and we could not have gone through XXXX modifications in two weeks when it never took less than 5 months on any occasion ( sometimes as much as 9 months ). 

We have never denied signing and notarizing the Subordinate Deed and Deed of Trust as part of our attempt to modify, but the plain truth is that after returning those documents Bank of America never fulfilled their end of the deal and completed our modification. In essence, documents were delivered to HUD and to our county Register 's office FRAUDULANTLY AS BANK OF AMERICA NEVER APPROVED OUR FINAL MODIFICATION IN THESE INSTANCES ... resulting in negligence on their part, either intentionally or unintentionally, that has prevented us from selling our home on at least one occasion in the past and is threatening to prevent another in three weeks.

6/26/16,Alpha Recovery Corp,TX,782XX,Debt collection,Credit card,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I have been paying on a XXXX Credit Card debt that went into collections since 2008. Initially my account was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I made a balloon payment of {$1000.00} and paid {$150.00} per month for all these years. 

Recently my account was moved to Alpha Recovery Corp. and my payments of {$150.00} per month via my debit card continued. On XXXX XXXX approximately XXXX CST I answered my phone. A man on the other end asked, "" Is this XXXX? '' I said, "" Yes. '' The man then said, "" What is your birth date? '' I replied, "" Who is this? '' The man said, "" I am not going to tell you until you give me your birth date. '' I said, "" I am not going to give out my birth date to someone who wo n't even identify themselves. '' The man then said, "" This is XXXX. '' I then recalled that I had spoken in the past to a man named XXXX with XXXX. I said, "" Is this XXXX with XXXX? '' He replied, "" No, I am with Alpha. '' I then said, "" I remember you. We have spoken before. '' I then gave him my birth date. XXXX XXXX never disclosed he was calling to collect a debt. I had to guess and figure out who he was and why he was calling. 

XXXX XXXX with Alpha Recovery Corp informed me that my current payment arrangement had expired and I needed to pay the entire debt off now. I told him I was not able to do that and would need to continue the payments. I asked XXXX, "" Who is XXXX? '' I asked him this because when the payments are taken out of my account my account shows the payments are going to a company named XXXX. XXXX XXXX told me his client was XXXX XXXX, which I know is not true. 

XXXX XXXX would not disclose how much I owed on the account nor would he provide a settlement amount. He did however keep insisting I use a credit card to charge a settlement amount to them. He threw out percentages, but never talked numbers. I have had this conversation with XXXX XXXX before and I informed him once again, that I was not going to charge an amount I would not be able to pay and get into financial trouble again. XXXX XXXX then said, "" So you are refusing to pay? '' I explained to him I was not refusing to pay, but needed to continue a payment arrangement to which he just hung up on me. 

The next day, XXXX XXXX I called Alpha Recovery and requested that I be able to speak to someone other than XXXX XXXX about my account. I was put on hold and transferred to XXXX XXXX so I hung up. I also called Alpha 's complaint line and left a message, but never received a call back. I sent an email to their corporate office to no avail. 

After paying on the XXXX XXXX collections debt for nine years I think it is possible this debt is paid off! Yet, Alpha Recovery now has the debt and will not provide me with information nor have I been able to speak with someone who is reasonable and honest.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Servicemember,Web,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1985506
5/14/15,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,OK,740XX,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"In XXXX, I took out XXXX loans with XXXX XXXX, a private student lender. During the financial crisis, the company went bankrupt and the loan was sold off XXXX times and ended up being owned by Wells Fargo. Time passed and I graduated in XXXX XXXX. I was n't made aware of the multiple sales of my loans until Wells Fargo XXXX collections department called in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. They harassed me and my parents with endless phone calls, threatening to take my parents ' home and sue me if I did n't make full arrears payments. I did what I could to make it work ; I got a new job and moved to a new city to earn a little more money ( my monthly payments on all my loans was around $ XXXX/mo and I only earned {$29000.00} a year. I made monthly payments but fell behind XXXX month. Within days, they charged off the loans and demanded payment in full. While they were threatening more legal action, I contacted attorneys, bankers, my legislators and the CFPB, and because my legislators and the CFPB contacted them directly, WF XXXX finally started to work with me on a repayment plan. 
Since that time, I have made consistent, on-time, in-full payments each month and have been attempting to rebuild my credit. I took a thorough look at my credit report recently and noticed Wells Fargo has been incorrectly reporting my repayment status ever since our repayment agreement was reached. It shows I 've been 90 days late at least XXXX times on each loan, and it 's simply not true. I 've paid on time each month, and have actually increased the payment amount I send them above our agreed-to amount. My credit report also shows that I have a past due balance on each loan, which is also inaccurate. Upon my initial contact with WF XXXX, the number of late payments showing on my XXXX credit report dropped from XXXX for each loan to XXXX for each loan, so obviously, someone at WF XXXX thought what they were doing was wrong, but those XXXX payments should still not be on my credit report. 
These specific items have prevented me from being able to get a small car loan from my credit union to replace my aging vehicle. Where I live, a person must have a reliable car to function - we do n't have good transit service. When I applied for the auto loan, I was told the loan was denied specifically because of these items on my credit report. 
I have attempted to remedy the situation by contacting Wells Fargo XXXX directly, but they claim they have the right to report my accounts in this way. I 'm not disputing the charged-off status of the loans ( though I do still think how they handled this was wrong in every way imaginable and the loan should still be in a normal status ). I am disputing the intentionally inaccurate reporting of my accounts as having been 90 days late XXXX times on each loan and having a past due balance on each loan. I would really like the CFPB 's assistance with the matter, because it seems it 's the only way anything will change.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1375025

Finally, this company sent a stranger to my house on XXXX XXXX, 2016 who never identified himself, only stated he wanted to hand me a letter from Coastal Credit, and requesting that I call them in front of him, while he was there. So I called Coastal Credit and I was put on hold for while and I finally told the man I had things to do and I paid my car payment on XXXX XXXX. The man verified my information, it was the same information that Coastal Credit all ready received, and the man then left after verifying information. Shortly after this Coastal Credit representative who name is XXXX called and left message on my phone to call her before Monday and she did not see the payment that I stated I paid. So I call Coastal Credit and I was unable to talk to XXXX due to the representative saying she was on the phone with another customer. So I begin stating that the reason why I was calling about the car payment and sending a stranger to my house. The representative begin to tell me that she did not see the car payment as well and I told her I did send it and the payment is showing up on my debit card transaction. The representative then proceed to say let me check another system, I was placed on hold again, and the payment is in the other system. So I begin to express my frustration with this situation, particularly with XXXX stating she did not see the payment, and sending a stranger to my house. The only answer the representative could give me is the stranger sent to my house is another way of communication. I told the representative I have previous loan companies and no one has ever sent anyone to my home. The representative told me she was not going back and forth me. I also told the representative that maybe they should check all there systems before stating someone did not pay their payment.

Now they have had three payments for the month of XXXX but they are not showing on my account when I look online.

Also I ca n't understand why or how they can go in my account on off set days to pay back my loan but ca n't go in on the due date. Then when they mess up I have to pay for it. My pay day loan should be done being paid for on XXXX/XXXX/2016 XXXX stated today that it has been extended until another month XXXX/XXXX/2016.

I also stated this to them on the XXXX. No one I mean no one said that I was going to be charged and extra XXXX before the end of the month was out so I have to over draft fees of {$34.00} for each.

Employee indicated "" it was time to stop playing games and that FAST had tried calling many times to resolve the debt.

Employee stated, "" XXXX XXXX, payments will not be accepted and it is time to stop playing games and pay the balance in full, otherwise a judgment will be filed. Stop being ignorant. '' Told member such language would not be tolerated and hung up. 

Contacted the Creditor and explained the circumstances. Creditor indicated a call would be made to FAST to see if any arrangements could be made. Received a call from the Creditor indicating FAST had agreed to make payments. Creditor also apologized for the inappropriate actions of the employee of FAST. 

Immediately contacted the employee of FAST to schedule payments and was forwarded to another employee. Employee set up payments and apologized for the actions of the other employee. Told FAST that the initial employee was no longer allowed to call again.

Finally I am contacting CFPB to get this handled after years of struggling to remove Check N Go account off my record and credit report. I opened a Installment loan for {$3000.00} with Check N Go sometime around XXXX that had manual setups for payment, which i was always current on. Also the check was deposited into my account and the money from the check did not get spent in full so my balance had all monies in my account for any current payments. However, I unexpectedly received notification from XXXX XXXX XXXX that Check N Go cashed my full check for the full amount {$3000.00} which took out all the money from my bank account as well as disrupted scheduled bills on my account, leading to bounced checks and returned payments on my account. Eventually XXXX XXXX XXXX charged me a lot of return check fees and ending up in having to force close my account as well. When i tried to contact Check N Go at the location which i received my loan they informed me the employee who cashed my check no longer works at the store and that they could not help me. Also I was told to contact the fraud dept. for Check N Go but that dept. does not help and canceling/closing this account to show as cleared. I ended up having to pay all my bills and accounts that hit my credit report but the check n go account is still listed on my credit report also they have me on radar for bounced checks so it is hard for me to open up bank accounts. I have neither emails from Check N Go nor any phone calls regarding any missed payments because I was up to date with all payments. 
This year I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and had them pull up all of my account statements so I could see my available balances as well as pinpoint the exact timeframe where Check N Go cashed the held check for the full {$3000.00} that they had on file. My weekly payments where current and the money was in the bank for all payments until after they had cashed then check then my account went downhill. 

I also took the liberty of searching for others who have been affected from Check ' N GO financially by their installment loans. It seems this is not a new concept and a lot of their employees mishandle customer 's information as well as company policies in the way to conduct business with their installment loans and payments.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2079835

I was never 30 days late in all the years. Meanwhile, a late fee of {$170.00} a month was secretly accruing unbeknownst to me!!! I never had a "" past due '' notice or a late fee notice online where I do all of my payments and business with Nationstar. It ALWAYS just showed the minimum amount due each time. SUDDENLY, years later a PAST DUE notice of more than {$5000.00} shows up. I called because it had to be a mistake. Nope. It was them finally telling me online in the payment center that I had a late fee that has been accruing every month for years! I HAD NO IDEA! There is no reminder ... there is not alert ... there is no box that pops up that warns you when you pay -- -ONLY a notice that a {$10.00} transaction fee will be assessed if you pay past 15 days. That makes it appear as though that 's the late fee. If they would have had XXXX notice that I had a past due amount because of a late fee I would have IMMEDIATELY changed my habits of paying the last two weeks of the month to the first two. I NEVER would have allowed this to happen. But they do it secretly and bury it in a statement in the mail, only -- so those who pay online -- which must be most everyone -- NEVER know about this until they alert you after it reaches some {$5000.00} or more. When I called they said, "" do n't worry -- we 'll move that amount to the back of the loan. '' They are loving this late fee and do n't want you to know about it. I think this is unbelievably deceptive. I am enraged about it.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1753156

10/14/16,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,AZ,852XX,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Taking out the loan or lease,,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I had purchased a truck from XXXX XXXX. I told the finance manager I would have the funds to payoff the truck in 5-7 business days. They assigned Wells Fargo as the payee. They told me the payoff amount would be {$42000.00} as stated in the sales contract and that I would make that payment to Wells Fargo. About a week later, I received a statement from Wells Fargo dated XXXX/XXXX/2016. The billing cycle due date on that statement as well as in the sales contract was XXXX/XXXX/2016. There was no payoff amount in that statement and I had to call Wells Fargo to confirm the payoff balance. I didnt get the reps name, but I specifically asked her to give me the amount to payoff & close out my account and she had given me the same figure on the sales contract : {$42000.00}. I immediately went to my nearest Wells Fargo branch to payoff the vehicle. The receipt from the branch shows that {$42000.00} was posted to that account on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Three weeks later I get a statement dated XXXX/XXXX/16 from Wells Fargo that shows my account was not only open, but I was charged {$50.00} "" interest ''. Statement shows that account did not post for the full amount I made at the branch which resulted in the account being left open. I called the XXXX # on the statement which is actually the collections dept for the Wells Fargo dealer services division. I got nowhere close to resolving this and none of the people including the "" supervisor '' would give me their full name or even the name of the top manager of that dept. The terms of the sales contract clearly states that I would pay no prepayment penalty. The contract was also very vague or wouldnt state at all when interest would start accruing and whether or not I would pay interest if account was payed off before billing cycle due date. I paid it off on XXXX and the XXXX due date was a month later on XXXX. Based on my past experience with other banks and financial institutions, Ive never had to pay interest on loans ( including auto ) when I paid off the balance in full before the billing cycle due date. I did not need to or wanted to take out a loan for the vehicle since I was able to pay it off in less that 7 business days. Had I known I would have problems with Wells Fargo, I wouldve stopped the dealership from involving Wells Fargo in the transaction and just pay the dealership directly. I 'm not just upset about the {$50.00} "" interest '' charge. I 'm also not surprised that Wells Fargo is using an unethical gray area loophole to keep my account open, extort "" interest '' charges '', and hold my car title hostage. I am filing this complaint because I want Wells Fargo to close out my loan account and release my car title regardless of whether or not I have to pay that {$50.00} "" interest '' charge. Because of Wells Fargo 's criminal indictment by the Justice Dept. for fraud and misconduct, I can not trust them to do the right thing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with monetary relief,No,No,2161396

In XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ocwen postponed the foreclosure sale date to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which allowed us enough time to process for HAFA. I submitted the same package but with updated financials on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They began processing. I supplied all the required items. Then in XXXX XXXX they ordered a new appraisal. Appraisal came in at the same value as it was previously. In XXXX, Ocwen also made a change to the address within their system changng it from legal description of XXXX. This required us to resubmit paperwork with a new address. They ended up allowing it to remain on my paperwork as XXXX. But still required me to resubmit the entire packag again. They mademe do this multiple times. With different reason given as to why. In XXXX Ocwen requested an update Unpaid Principal Balance statement from the second mortgage company. I finally was able to obtain the UPB and sent to Ocwen as soon as I received it. This is when they finally reviewed the file in its entirety, even though prior to this point they had everything they needed to review and approve. Also, in XXXX XXXX Ocwen told me that it was against the HAFA guidelines that a buyer/real estate broker to contribute funds towards the 2nd lien. We were able to get past that and moved forward with that issue. Then on XXXX XXXX, I called to get an update on the file. The guy ( XXXX ) I spoke to said it looked like the quality team is going to deny the current offer price because the current offer price was n't going to net them as much as a foreclosure sale would net them ( Ocwen ). But that, that note was not official yet. On XXXX XXXX, I received an email with a letter attached stating that our price was in fact not acceptable but that we could submit a higher offer. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX @ Ocwen and rquested what amont I needed to counter the buyer at. Hetold me thata purchase closer to {$98000.00} or a minimum acceptable net proceeds of {$63000.00}. I worked with the buyer 's agent and the buyer 's agreed to pay a higher price so that Ocwen would approve. I sent the paperwork over to Ocwen on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

I was told the documents were still in review. I called again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - 10 days from our sale date because I am trying to get an approval to close this file - This is when I was told by XXXX @ Ocwen that management is requesting the removal of the {$10000.00} relocation incentive to the seller because we were to close to the foreclosure sale date for the seller to get a relocation incentive. I sent over a revised settlement statement minutes after getting off the phone with XXXX. I called this morning XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to verify if the revised settlement statement was received. I spoke with XXXX @ Ocwen whom told it was received and that she expedited the file to the team and hopes that it will be reviewed within 24 - 48 hours.

I have been adjusting my due dates a day before they are due to ensure payment is receive on the adjusted due date. I recently received a call from the company stating that I have 2 months of late fees for the last two payments I was allowed to adjust.

I advised the company that my contract states that if my payment is received after the XXXX a late fee will be assessed. However, the contract does n't state that if my payment is adjusted to a later date with the companies permission that I would still be assessed a late fee. I advised the company that the only reason my payments would be made after the XXXX would be because that is how I am paid by my employer. I also told the company if I am given permission by the company to adjust my due date to a later date that may possibly be after the XXXX of the month depending on how I am paid I should not be assessed a late fee. 

The company basically blew me off and said "" Just make sure you pay on time ''.

10/1/15,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,601XX,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"To begin my story, I decided to attend XXXX School specifically XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. At the time, I had just gone through a bankruptcy so I had to take out a private student loan which had a high interest rate to pay for college. Everything was ok at the beginning, I started to attend class and was doing very well. As I was attending class I was put on a payment plan by the XXXX XXXX, things were ok for a while but as school started to get more demanding I could not work as much and my payment plan with the school started to suffer. Because, I could not keep up with my payment plan, I was told by the administrative staff at the Culinary Academy that I was going to be withdrawn from the school for non-payment. The most disappointing aspect of all this was that I was XXXX semesters from graduating!! So, after a long battle with the school, I start my XXXX career, which needless to say was extremely hard. There was never enough money to pay off the private and/or federal student loans, so I had to keep putting my loans in a deferred status, I think at one point I started with a XXXX to XXXX XXXX dollar loan and it just ballooned over time to XXXX XXXX dollarrs because I could never pay it back. I went along like this for years, until I ran out of time, I could no longer defer my payments. Since XXXX or XXXX I have been struggling to pay my student loans. At one point, I was so destitute I could not pay the loans and my credit was ruined by the loan provider ( XXXX XXXX XXXX I finally reached out to them and they got my loans back on track so I would not default, however it was too late my credit had already been damaged. Since then, I have tried to keep up but the payments for my private loan and federal loan add up to about roughly {$800.00} a month ... I just ca n't pay that anymore!! As of XXXX I reached out to XXXX which is now Navient and tried to work out a interest rate reduction and or payment amount reduction with Navient but they have yet to agree some relief!. They advised that me and my co-signer had to perform a financial analysis, which we did, only to be told that I did not qualify!! Which I do n't believe. As it stands right, I have a outstanding loan of about {$69000.00} dollars and {$40000.00} of that are part of the private loan and the private loan payment is {$600.00} a month at almost 14 % interest. At this rate I will not pay off my loan until XXXX, maybe even later ... I can not sustain this type of payment, I am going crazy!! it is really affecting my life. I am not sure what your organization can do to help, but any help would be much appreciated. The guess the most hurtful thing about all of this is that I did not get to graduate from college, I did not get a degree but I am still paying XXXX dollars to an organization ( Navient, formerly know as XXXX ) and having nothing to show for it.

One of the best features for me as I got older was Chase Quickpay. It was an amazing tool to use being that I left XXXX to go to college out of state and was able to receive / send money back to my family in XXXX. As I 've gotten older it 's become even more beneficial as I have relocated from my hometown and use the function to send money to my family. Chase had this wonderful option which made me feel safe and secure that if for some reason I typed out an incorrect address or phone number I had a grace period where I can cancel the transaction, and the money would not be deposited into said account. I do n't know who is responsible for the decision making at Chase, but whoever thought it was a great idea to REMOVE that option and AUTOMATICALLY deposit the money into the 2nd parties account, really messed up. I sent a quickpay for {$740.00} to an incorrect address, I noticed immediately it was an incorrect address and notified chase as quick as possible. They said it would take about 3-5 business days to get a response or action on my claim and to keep my eyes peeled to my email address. The 3-5 business days had passed and I 'd yet to hear any thing back from the Bank, I called them myself to follow up and they informed me they would re-file my claim and get back to me. It has been a total of ( 17 ) days since I first filed the claim and I have yet to receive any type of follow up. I called Chase this morning only to be told that "" Oh, well if you have n't heard anything back that means we ca n't help you, we do not have any Quickpay protection it 's up to the consumer to make the right decision. '' Seriously? That is the response I get? After waiting this entire time it took that gentleman 2 seconds to tell me this while the rest of the company has had me in Limbo? How can this be? How can you DELETE a function that protects your VALUED customers and then when an issue arises basically kick them to the curb and inform them that sorry, your money is n't our concern? How is this possible? I just want the situation rectified, I have complied with all of Chase 's demands and needs pertaining to this matter and yet there is nothing they can do at all to rectify the situation? How do you not plan for this or have a system in place to protect your customers.

XXXX XXXX agreed to relieve me of all financial obligation, garnishments, and prompt deletion of credit entries in exchange for a one-time payment of {$3000.00}. The payment was immediately rendered and the stipulations were signed by a judge of the XXXX County District Court that same month. Experian keeps verifying the debt as valid because XXXX XXXX is supplying fictitious information because collection efforts remain in effect for second party on account. XXXX County District Court has assured me that they do not verify debts, make entries to credit reports or make deletions. 
Equifax also has an account listed by XXXX Collections in the amount of {$81.00}. This account was paid directly to XXXX several months ago. I was never contacted by XXXX by any means. The representative that I spoke with said the account would be deleted but she could not send in writing. She referred me to a website to print a paid letter. I have proof that I paid XXXX directly.

Equifax also has several collection accounts that have been paid and I have provided written proof supplied by the collection agency for medical bills. The companies are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX collections. The collection companies agreed to delete the entries electronically but they remain on my credit file. 
Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has an open claim with XXXX XXXX for damages on a vehicle that I rented in South Dakota from XXXX thru XXXX while on of several travel contracts for work at XXXX XXXX XXXX.

From what I can tell, apparently XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX take care of all the legal proceedings for Midland Funding, a company that purchased my credit card debt from XXXX, in the amount of {$3500.00}. 

Back in XXXX, I went through a financial hardship, and was having difficulties maintaining my mortgage payment and keeping up with credit card debt. I had no choice but to walk away from our home and all debt. As a consequence for my financial irresponsibility, my credit score dropped all the way down to XXXX and stayed there for over 7 years, making it very hard for my wife and I to purchase things like automobiles, a new home, or get any type of new credit. 

At the XXXX, nearly 7 years later, most of that bad debt started to drop off of my credit report as a result of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) rules and regulations. Through secure credit cards and other means my credit score started to improve ( XXXX ). 

Then in XXXX XXXX, while logging into my credit monitoring account ( XXXX ), I noticed that my credit score had dropped significantly. It was the result of a new default judgement showing up as a public record. Here are the details of this judgement : Date Filed : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Reference # : XXXX Court : XXXX CO Magistrate Plaintiff : Midland Funding LLC Amount : {$3400.00} I was never given notice of this lawsuit, nor was I ever served. I believe this debt had already exceeded the statute of limitations from the date of last activity ( DLA ). Yet, it is not haunting me, and preventing me from purchasing a new home many years later. 

I also found this article published on your site related to the the unethical business practices used by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in attempt to make financial gains, through the use of questionable default judgements, at the expense of their victims.

Previous ATP had expired and we were working toward another ATP. No offer during the 1st ATP was close enough to bank value of home. 
Wells Fargo refused to review the offer until the "" financial review '' was completed. Then Welles Fargo delayed ( intentionally ) by continually waiting long stretches of not returning messages, constantly changing "" processors '', as many as 8 processors, underwriters have been on this file, each with a period of no communication. 
The worst was "" XXXX '', who throughout this process failed to either return a phone call or email, in a timely manner, but mostly not at all. 
We sent an OTP and related paperwork to WF to continue with a short sale process on XX/XX/XXXX. We continued to work on this short sale, up until it was rejected in XX/XX/XXXX, for missing a document. Someone from WF Home Preservation Department called XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX.and XXXX responded and faxed the documents. Since XXXX did not receive these documents, and I was unaware that the WF Team was calling the borrower, the file was rejected. I recent the same documents, by fax, on XX/XX/XXXX. After I found out what had happened, XXXX helped, and put in the request to be reactivated, on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Wells Fargo proceeded to change processors, and micro-examine all accounts, effectively delaying the review within days of the foreclosure sale. They even took two weeks, examining and rejecting a settlement statement from the HOA, finally at last stating that the standard settlement email, with letterhead, management company, and all parties copied, must now be a "" formal '' letter on letterhead, and signed, ( note that offer has not been looked at ). 
Nothing had materially changed in the Borrower 's financial condition, and Wells Fargo knew it. 
We tried for weeks by emails and calls, to expedite the review, stating each time the impending foreclosure. WE WERE IGNORED, and when we were communicated, it was "" on script '' nonsense. In XXXX, we took the fight to anyone who might listen. 
Suddenly, on XX/XX/XXXX ( sale date XX/XX/XXXX ), the offer was "" reviewed '', and quickly rejected. We were told on Monday the news, and told to "" get a higher offer '' WE were told "" an ATP could NOT be issued, due to the "" LOW OFFER '' and "" TOO CLOSE TO FC SALE DATE. 
We were also told there is nothing anyone can do.

'' no check but, a credit to my account. Wells Fargo did not do as statement reads. same mailing as Doc XXXX & XXXX explain the reason for refund and a credit ( not a check ). Wells Fargo did not allow me to be in control of the money they took from me. then after getting caught taking my re-fund they decided to add the amount to my principle. I feel it was not right for Wells Fargo to make this decision without my consent via the above rule that they stated in writing about overages. 
Wells Fargo added insult to injury as Doc XXXX show a "" XXXX '' for {$1000.00} as received XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in which I had to pay taxes on the amount credited it the principal of my loan, which was a loss around {$200.00}, that I would have gotten back on my taxes. 
Doc XXXX shows more interest income for {$24.00}. I believe I have never received that refund, and I had to pay taxes on that amount as well! 
Wells Fargo has taken money from me, returns it to me but, decides to pay on the principle of my loan which benefits them ; and only after getting caught then you know what those nice folks did next, why yes, I have to pay taxes on the money they took form me, and already paid taxes on to pay the taxes again. Therefore, the end result was that I paid taxes twice on two different amounts, I believe that is double dipping and I am sure this is not legal. Also, they did not follow their own written policy regrading overages and refunds. 
When I called Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to inquire about this concern I was told that, "" well sir we could sent you back the payment you just made at the XX/XX/XXXX ''. I thought, no thanks if I took that offer I would have to pay taxes on that in XXXX.

Deceptively opening the account 's with bait-n-switch only to have adverse actions affect these reports into the future that we have been working so hard to solidify is absolutely INFURIATING!!

Approving an account for a week only to create a negative impact on the CRBs for years to come is Unfair Trade Practices against consumers ; an initial denial would have been one thing but to create a long term blemish is despicable! Just downright nasty and unbecoming ; corporate mentality : short term bottom line.

1/23/17,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MD,207XX,Credit card,,Credit line increase/decrease,,Synchorny bank lowerinf credit limit after paying down balances. I recently submitted a complaint with CFPB about being reported late. I have had a number of accounts with Synchrony. I advised them that their history must be wrong. I habe not had any problems with all of my other Synchrony accounts. Shortly after filing the complaint with CFPB Synchrony lowered my credit limit on my banana republic card. I then closed the account as the new limit was {$100.00}. You can not purchase much with that limit. I then filed a started litigation against Synchrony bank. Last week i paid down balances on a few of my Synchrony accounts. While checking my credit report tonight I noticed that Synchrony now lowered my credit limit on my Lowes card. I recently paid the account down from 68 percent to 2 percent. I guess since they can not make money off of me with zero to low balances they take it upon themself to lower yoir credit limit. Had i known that they would lower my credit limit once i paid the account down i would have paid the money on a different bill. This now affects my utilization scoree. I have been faithful with my Synchrony accounts with no 30 days on any of the accounts except for whatever mix up with the Banana Card.

7/29/15,KEYCORP,TX,770XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I relocated in XX/XX/2014 and found there are no Key Bank branches in XXXX. Shortly after that I saw online that my checking account was being overdrafted due to interest charges and late fees on my overdraft line that caused the overdraft line to be over limit. I called the customer service line and told them I had not been receiving statements. I had multiple contacts with them during which I asked for statements, advised of my new address and requested to close my accounts they failed to update my address and refused to close the accounts. I received letters stating I owe and get calls while I 'm at work but still do n't receive statements ( even though I was promised that I would ). The letters are sent to my former address so they have n't even updated that. I also asked about how I can make payments and some representatives have allowed me to make payments via phone while others tell me this option is not available. I feel the conflicting information is a means of deceiving me and preventing me from paying so that they can continue to assess late fees. 
Finally in XX/XX/2014 I was directed to call my old branch in Indiana ( why had n't the numerous previous representatives I had spoken with advised me about this? ) and they were able to assist with closing the checking account. I called back to customer service and explained I had difficulty paying the account and asked if there was any way to work out an arrangement for monthly payments and no interest. I was told that this could be done but it was n't and the overdraft line kept accruing interest and late fees but Key Bank still was n't providing billing statements. 
In short, I have notified Key Bank of my address multiple times but they have failed to update it. I have requested billing statements but they refuse to provide it. I 've been lied to about acceptable methods of payments, how interest will be accrued, and that statements would be sent. Key Bank has refused to work with me despite my explaining I 'm willing to make regular payments. 
Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that they charged overdraft fees on my checking account due to late fees and interest that they assessed on my overdraft line even though they failed to provide statements for that account. This is an unfair and predatory practice. It is essentially a double jeopardy with the bank unfairly penalizing me for a situation that they created with their own negligence in failing to properly update their records upon notification.",,,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1491889

The last time I used it was for the purchase of a train ticket. However, that trip did n't happen so I got a partial refund of the ticket price, leaving around {$30.00} as a balance. Then I left U.S for 3 weeks and forgot about this balance since I did not use this card often ( only when I made a purchase at Bloomingdale 's ). After 4 months I got XXXX calls asking me to pay off and card balance and at that point it was $ XXXX including all late charges. And my card was closed because I missed all the payments. So I paid off the huge amount. However, another 3 months later I got XXXX calls asking me to pay additional $ XXXX late charges. It was just unacceptable! Why would they let me know earlier and why would there be additional charges after my card was closed! The worst thing is, after I negotiated with them ( they were just unfriendly and unhelpful ), I paid another {$42.00} and made sure that would the last payment I make -- it is still unreasonable to me but I 'm super busy, I do n't want to be haunted by them again, not to mention my credit history could be negatively impacted. I thought it was the end. But today, I saw another {$4.00} charge posted to that account -- I mean seriously? What are they trying to do to me!!! This is unbelievable and unacceptable!!!

After I became a homeowner in XX/XX/XXXX, I kept monitoring my credit reports/scores with the intention of refinancing my home within the next year and be able to obtain a lower interest rate. This past week, my car broke down, therefore against my will, I found myself in need of a new car, this meant that I would have to allow a creditor to pull my credit and take the "" hard-hit '' on my credit report. I looked for a new vehicle online for several days. I saved information of the vehicles I was interested in, I 've contacted the dealers and owners of the vehicles to make sure they were still available and at that point I scheduled time to go out and test drive the cars. After many days of researching pros and cons on my already narrowed-down choices, I finally picked the car I was comfortable buying. The car was at XXXX a dealership in XXXX XXXX, IL. I visited the dealer, XXXX a sales man greeted us ( my husband and I ) and showed us the car, we test drove the car and decided it was time to sit-down and negotiate on the price, we set-down with XXXX ( the sales man ). Once we started discussing financing options, I explained my situation and made XXXX aware that I was monitoring my credit meticulously, I explained my reasons and told him I would allow them ( the dealer ) to pull my credit report XXXX and mentioned that I did not wanted more than XXXX "" hard-hit '' on my credit report. It was late at night, past their closing time. They kept coming back with offers on monthly payment that I was not pleased with. At this point, I was under the impression they were negotiating on the price, they did not mention they were allowing several banks to pull my credit report.

I was notified by my lender Wells Fargo that no payment was due for 90 days. Once my insurance company granted a check for damages Wells Fargo would not endorse check because I had not made a payment XX/XX/XXXX. I brought with me the Wells Fargo letter stating that I had 90 days ( payment due XX/XX/XXXX ) to make payments. I made the payments before the 90 days and Wells Fargo still did not endorse my insurance claim check. I was instructed by Wells Fargo to write a letter asking for a review for my check to be endorsed which process would take 10 days. They denied the review I had to write a second letter and resubmit and wait ten more days my insurance claim check was not endorsed until XX/XX/XXXX. Also XX/XX/XXXX I was laid off awarded unemployment benefits. Being unemployed for six months and dealing with the disaster of floods has put us in a tight situation also child support payments for my children stopped XX/XX/XXXX due to absent parent unemployment. I notified my lender for payment options I was current until XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised to apply for their unemployment mortgage assistance program which will give me six months to catch up on payments or three months added to back of the loan. I was notified XX/XX/XXXX that I did not qualify for the unemployment because I was not receiving unemployment benefits for six months. That is incorrect information because I became unemployed XX/XX/XXXX and received XXXX until I started working XX/XX/XXXX. Kept calling the lender for assistance and was referred to do a loan modification. Again, I disclosed situation mentioned above thus, the financial hardship I submitted all my documentation with an explanation that XX/XX/XXXX I started working received my first check for {$500.00} for the whole month. My employer only pays once a month my next full check is on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, the hours worked XX/XX/XXXX is paid XX/XX/XXXX and the hours worked XX/XX/XXXX will be paid XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo denied my loan modification and informed me that because my loan was already modified and the best option would be for me to sell my home. I explained to Wells Fargo I and my XXXX children have been in the home for eleven years would like to keep it and it will be impossible to sell the home before they foreclose on property. I was sent a letter that I have until XX/XX/XXXX date to make payment of {$3000.00} after this date foreclosure begins. I was also told that I should have applied for unemployment program which I did and was unjustifiably denied because I was unemployed I asked for a review was told that is not an option. If they would take the three months XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and roll to the back of the loan I can start making payments XX/XX/XXXX. The point is to assist I purchased the home for XXXX I have equity in the home I do n't want to lose it we have lived in it for 11 years ' other homes in the area have sold for {$350000.00} and higher I believe WF does not want to assist so they can sell the property and gain top market profit. Instead of helping us I was unemployed for six months yet made the payments XX/XX/XXXX is when things got tighter and I started working XX/XX/XXXX. They are not very helpful I called for clarification and for other options and all I got was sell the home, you got a loan modification from the previous year. Thus, I inquired on that situation a year later still no resolution why my mortgage increased to {$170000.00} if before modification the balance was {$170000.00} I made payments all of XX/XX/XXXX.

12/28/15,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MA,011XX,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"To Whom It May Concern : Please be advised that the filing of this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( "" CFPB '' ) follows a summary complaint filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencies ( "" O.C.C. "" ), without supporting documents, and is intended to notify Bank of America ( "" BofA '' ) of my intentions to pursue litigation for unfair and deceptive banking practices as it relates to recording bank transactions ( i.e. backdating banking activity ) in an effort to charge additional overdraft bank fees. I 've incurred these overdraft charges as a result of either a broad and systemic bank issue or the bank has intentionally levied fees against me in the wake of a successful consumer lawsuit against the bank. The lawsuit involved a consumer credit reporting dispute against Bank of America involving the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ) to which the bank was found negligent back in XXXX XXXX in the XXXX District Court of Massachusetts. 
The following provides a summary explanation of banking activity involving a primary checking account and XXXX bill payments processed through the primary checking account that evidently occurred between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Bank notifications supplied by Bank of America call into question the sequence of the XXXX bill payments as well as the accuracy of the primary checking account 's balance on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which the bank controlled and therefore relied upon to charge the overdraft fees. The sequence of these XXXX bill payments and the resulting overdraft fees is neither consistent nor supported by customer notifications initiated by the bank to indicate recent bank activity and the primary checking account 's balance ( s ). 
The primary checking account that my wife and I hold with Bank of America had a beginning balance of {$41.00} prior to XXXX bill payment transactions that Bank of America has reported as occurring on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] A payment to my wife 's XXXX XXXX account was scheduled to transact on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for {$30.00} through the bank 's online payment web portal. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email notification from Bank of America indicating that our primary checking account balance fell below the {$25.00} pre-determined amount that was set by the customer to notify of low balances. [ See Exhibit XXXX XXXX The email notification indicates that the primary checking account balance of {$41.00} had decreased to {$11.00} as expected following the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment. 
On the following day XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I received another email notification the primary checking account had become overdrawn. As the bank explains, the overdrawn balance was the result the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX bill payment as well as a bill payment for {$180.00} to XXXX. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Based on the documentation and statements provided by Bank of America, I contacted their customer support center on the evening of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to dispute the overdraft charge on the XXXX XXXX payment and to request a refund of that overdraft fee. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] The explanation by the bank representative as well as the notifications and statements do not support the processing of the {$180.00} XXXX payment first. First, Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates that a {$30.00} transaction occurred to change the primary checking account balance from a beginning balance of {$41.00}, to {$11.00}. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Secondly Exhibit XXXX clearly indicates the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in sequence as evidenced by the transaction number ( s ) indicated in the bank 's document. Finally, Exhibit XXXX shows the same sequencing of payments with the {$30.00} XXXX XXXX payment first in order. [ See Exhibit XXXX ] Please see the attached document for a full and complete narrative of the issue along with supporting statements and documentation.

The statement said that the charge was made to a "" XXXX XXXX '', a person I do not know and do not recognize a business relationship with. 
I went to the nearest Bank of America branch in order to dispute this charge. The person I spoke to at Bank of America called another department at Bank of America about the charge.

I do have service through XXXX, but when I called them afterwards they confirmed that any charges to my XXXX account would not be charged directly to my checking account, and that the XXXX charge was not their doing. 
Even if this charge was legitimate, I do not believe Bank of America should have authorized it. I have opened a bank account elsewhere, as my relationship with Bank of America has deteriorated beyond all repair due to another issue I am having with them.

I found out shortly after making another 12 month payment after that forbearance that the clock was reset on my loan payments so I would need to make another 2 years of consistent monthly payments. It seemed like this was misleading that I was not told that if at any time I chose to go into forbearance that my payment timeline to remove my mother as a cosigner for XXXX of XXXX loans would be reset. 
Wells Fargo Bank does not offer any other alternative for me to ease the burden of my student loan payments as the option I always receive from representatives are : 1. ) can you consolidate ( I can not do this option because that would require a cosigner- the only person of which is my mother who can not be used as a cosigner until she is removed from original loan ), 2. ) go into forbearance ( I can only do this option for 2 months effectively upping my interest balance while resetting the clock on the time it would take to remove my mother from original loan ), 3. ) cosigner would need to me payment if I could not. 
Having only 3 none useable options to ease such a large debt with such a high monthly balance is wrong and something should be done.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2306334

We co-signed student loans not fully understanding that much of student lending has been privatized and not subject to any relief programs such as forgiveness after 10 years of working in public service, etc. What happened to XXXX XXXX? 

Our student son is paying the public loans on a schedule based on his income and we are paying private ones since he makes very little money. It is really ridiculous for a college degree to cost so much money. His degree is in XXXX and XXXX, so he will likely be working for a modest salary all his life. Making the world a better place, but not pulling down the big bucks. 

Is there any relief for private loans? We are being impoverished since our student ca n't make all the payments, and we will be unable to retire. We can only make the payments, we ca n't pay off the principle, so we 'll be paying forever. Plus Navient is calling us relentlessly. The calls start BEFORE the bills arrive and persist until they receive the payments, even though we pay every month. We get a few days of peace and then it starts again, Navient also calls our son and threatens him with dire consequences like legal prosecution. We no longer answer our own home phone, we just return calls to our friends who leave a message. Navient has our son 's cell number, so they harass him at work, at home, wherever. And this is what they do to a family that is paying each month. Imagine how much it would crank up if we skipped a month?

Because of changed circumstances and starting to fall behind on my mortgage payments. I have managed to stay no more than two payments behind until present. I have submitted all requested "" required '' information and documents. Every time I submitted the requested documents, additional information was "" required ''. I was very conscious to not leave anything undone, or left out. However, every time I was told the same thing ; something was missing, incomplete or lost, and a request was made for additional "" new information '', which I provided. This same thing happened at least XXXX times. I am XXXX positive that I never left out or failed to provide what I was asked for. Very soon after starting the process of a modification/review, I was given a letter of 'Intent to Foreclose '. Also, an appraisal of my home was made. On XXXX/XXXX/15 my personal home loan team member, XXXX XXXX called me. I had been in constant communication with her and/or another team member throughout the last 5 months since starting this modification process. I had just submitted what I was told would be my final one, which included a most crucial document, one which took me the most time, effort, and money to acquire, a recorded quit claim deed along with XXXX other "" newly added '' documents. I had sent that "" final packet '' in a provided XXXX envelope, same as previously. I took it to XXXX at XXXX, XXXX airport. I was told that it would be delivered on Friday XXXX XXXX, 2015. I assumed that XXXX called ( not a scheduled appointment call ) to tell me that the packet was received and a decision could now finally be made. I questioned her about this. She told me that the packet was not received. I was shocked. She "" dug deeper '' into my file and said they received XXXX out of the XXXX final documents, but not the most crucial quit claim recorded copy. I was shocked and a little angry. I am absolutely XXXX positive that a copy was indeed enclosed. She requested/suggested that I resubmit it. XXXX then proceeded to tell me what I believe the "" real reason '' for her phone call was. She informed me that there was a "" transfer of servicing of loan mortgage '' to be done on XXXX/XXXX/15 along with all of my documents. I had only received this information the day before, on XXXX/XXXX/15 and was yet unopened. This letter was post marked XXXX/XXXX/15. This was not the 15 day minimum required notice.

I asked him 3 times who made the decision for my loan transfer. He reluctantly told me it was the service release department. I pressed on for a complaint form, he said maybe customer service could help me. He said he would document my complaint. I told him to document that I did not accept or authorize this transfer, especially since I had just found out about it 2 days before and they lost my final submittal of a quit claim copy. I told him to tell them to find it or acquire it themselves. ( It is public access at this point ). He then proceeded to transfer me to customer service, I waited and nobody answered. I found some other customer service numbers to call. Guess what, they all went to his "" home loan team '' department.

On the website XXXX I scheduled an appointment to my nearest branch as said on the website from the link on the website. I received email on XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX CT with confirmation number for appointment XXXX to open the account with above offer. I opened the checkings bank account next day with bank manager saying that bonus will be honored once direct deposits are made. I chatted with Bank of America representative same night to know when Bonus shall be received. She said that Bonus will be received after 90 days of meeting requirements. I did n't receive bonus till XXXX. I called Bank of America on XXXX XXXX on customer service. The representative said that after meeting requirements in 90 days, it usually takes around 1 month for processing the bonus. In XXXX I did n't receive any bonus. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I again called the customer representative that I did n't receive bonus in spite of continuous direct deposits. She asked me to call XXXX number as the Promotion department was closed that time. I called the above number on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I called the above number and everything was answered in XXXX. So I again called the customer care on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to take up the case, continuing from yesterday. He calls the promotional branch and replies that I am not eligible for Bonus. He tells me that my name is not there in their list. I tell them its not mandatory to open the account online, its given on the website that the account can also be opened by going to the branch and my scheduling appointment through the website is the proof of it. They told me that you can talk back to the branch. I am tired of this Flip-flop from one person to other. 
My logic is simple. I opened the account through the promotional offer website by going to branch. The branch person who opened my account. I met all requirements with all direct deposits till today. Now its their turn to honor the bonus. My work hours as a XXXX do n't give me time to go to the bank branch on weekdays like they want and I do n't understand, why I should go to the branch. They should contact the branch manager by themselves and resolve the issue, but the customer service do n't want to open the case. I think Bank of america just does n't want to honor the bonus and make their customers beg for bonus.

I have called the foreclosure attorneys repeatedly & no one has responded by mail, phone or otherwise since XX/XX/XXXX when they got involved. I requested a loan modification on my mortgage each month since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my hardship began. Each month the bank closed my file requesting documents which were already provided & /or which do not exist. A rep. at the bank advised me after foreclosure attorneys were involved I was n't eligible for a modification but still need to request it & if declined I then could work out a payoff quote. No one assisted in this matter whatsoever I was never declined. Every time I called the bank they said I did not provide records & every month I requested a payoff quote. Since I could not reach resolution & payoff amount from the bank or from the foreclosure attorneys I requested mediation. My check was cashed for {$50.00} & mediatio on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX date set. I mailed in documents as instructed by the foreclosure attorneys for mediation. An attorney I was working w/ also mailed in a request for mediation XXXX XXXX, XXXX & no one responded & not one person called us back. Since I have reported to my bank the foreclosure attorneys did not provide a payoff quote. The mortgage company said the foreclosure attorneys must provide a payoff quote & also must be notified of the mediation. The foreclosure attorneys were mailed copies the same & court got the documents but the bank & the foreclosure attorneys have not researched, have not assisted & not found the documents? This is consistent w/ the entire handling of my case-negligence. As a result a sale date established & since I have called the administrative hearings office, have called PNC Bank, have called the foreclosure attorneys & the only parties helping was the person at the administrative hearings office. I was advised unless there was a technicality she was not aware of the foreclosure sale date should have been canceled. However, this was not done! As I prepare my documents for mediation the bank has not reviewed carefully I called PNC on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & requested why my account was not in mediation & they advised me to call the foreclosure attorneys. I advised my bank as I have done repeatedly since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the foreclosure attorneys do not answer the phone, do not respond to letters, do not return phone calls. PNC Bank put me on hold & called the foreclosure attorneys on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & said they are requesting information from the administrative hearings. Each time I called PNC I requested my account documented why I was calling which is the foreclosure attorneys do not respond at all. Today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX an attorney assisting me told me there was a Motion to Strike Request for Mediation on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I feel it is the responsibility of the bank to advise me as I was calling each day as the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX sale date was coming. This account has already been compromised by several calling in & telling the bank erroneous information resulting in documents being requested of me which do not exist. Each time I call in PNC representatives tell me the previous rep. did not take any notes, did not assist me & did not input any information of the mediation in their systems despite assuring me they did so. I was assured by each PNC representatives "" they are doing all they can ''. They did not do anything which resulted in a Chp. XXXX Bankruptcy today to stop this sale. No guarantee at all. I 've been requesting mediation since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when PNC requested documents not applicable to my situation or me whatsoever.

Bill of Sale presented by Plaintiff, via their counsel, as evidence in this matter contains no reference to the Defendant, any personal information pertaining to the Defendant, nor the alleged account number or particular Debt being collected on, at issue in this action, nor is there "" exhibit attached to each bill of sale or other document transferring ownership of the Debt that is represented or warranted by a Seller to be a list all Debts acquired in that Portfolio. '' There is only a separate XXXX column printout page which does not meet the requirements of Order, and has no notation, header, footer or other identifying characteristic back to bill of sale.Although I requested adequate proof of ownership in Discovery via Request for Production of Documents, Plaintiff 's counsel objected to request as irrelevant. 
Also, Plaintiff 's counsel is in violation of XXXX of Consent Order, there is no direct reference in the original Complaint Affidavit nor Trial Affidavits as to the definitions of what or which documents the Affidavits to be "" personally acquainted with the facts stated herein. '' Trial is iset for XXXX. Plaintiff 's Counsel 's XXXX responses indicate no further documentation to be provided nor witnesses to be called, depriving me of opportunity to cross-examine affiants, No affidavits filed from alleged original creditor. 
This indicates a continued effort to litigate and collect on a debt which can not be properly proven, and a lack of appropriate documentation which, per Consent Order, must be in hand before filing suit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2037039

I contacted Associated Bank to find out why I had not received the provisional credit. At that time I was told my signed paperwork was not received. I was also told the dispute area was closed so they would have to call me on Monday. And that I would not get provisional credit until 10 days AFTER the signed paperwork was received.

6/20/16,AES/PHEAA,NC,274XX,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"While attending a XXXX program at New York XXXX I applied for and received Federal student loans ( opting not to take out any private loans ). Having finished my final semester, I had only XXXX "" course '' remaining : a specially listed course that entailed only my meeting and collaboration with the professor overseeing my work on the thesis. Leading up to this XX/XX/XXXX semester, XXXX, communicating on my behalf with student loans -- and completely without my knowledge -- somehow incorrectly assumed I would be "" XXXX. '' XXXX communicated this full-time status to Fedloans, prompting them to offer me a larger loan ( i.e., that which is appropriate for a full-time student ). 

Seeing the unnecessarily large amount that I had been disbursed, I went to my Fedloans account and sent back {$10000.00} in XXXX, XXXX ( at the beginning of the semester ). What XXXX subsequently did without my knowledge would result in the punishing financial burden I have born since XXXX -- XXXX that was impossible to anticipate and that has been impossible to manage. Four months after my XX/XX/XXXX i.e., in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX realizing their own error with regard to my XXXX status, and once more completely unbeknownst to me, XXXX sent back {$9700.00} of its own money to Fedloans. Incomprehensibly, in that moment, my debt to the federal government -- an unwieldy yet anticipated debt whose repayment I had, prior to XXXX XXXX, consciously accepted and planned for -- was compounded with a debt to XXXX that I had never consented to. 

Shocked by a sudden balance owed to XXXX ( from whom I never agreed to take money ), I spent weeks and weeks in order to finally ascertain that instead of simply passing the federal loans along to me, XXXX had incomprehensibly taken it upon themselves to become my lender. In essence, Fedloans lent money to XXXX who then lent money to me. 
According to this logic, my sending back {$10000.00} to Federal Loans in XXXX of XXXX did not correct things for XXXX. Though unidentified as such to me, they had ( apparently ) acted as my lender, and their mistake in requesting loans for a XXXX student meant that they ( not me ) would send back {$10000.00} to Fedloans ( 4 months after I 'd XXXX and moved on, that is ) and that I should owe them ( not Fedloans ) that amount. 

The result was finishing XXXX school with an absolutely unmanageable and unjust debt to XXXX. Not only would I have to repay my Fedloans according to difficult but anticipated and just terms, but I would have to repay XXXX immediately for a loan I had not solicited and something I could have never foreseen. 

XXXX has since had me trapped. Without any other apparent recourse, I argued and then pleaded, protesting that this was all a result of their error and unscrupulous practices. Recognizing this, they consented to helping me with a "" budget appeal form '' that would make me eligible for a new temporarily no-interest loan from XXXX. They allowed me to put this loan towards the remaining balance and thus lower it. Meanwhile, according to our unofficial agreement, I would make monthly payments towards my student balance while also working to repay the new loan. 

I fought this for a long time, speaking with Fed Loans at length and being assured by their offices that something was not right. Finally, without the financial resources available to seek legal help, I simply accepted my predicament and have lived with it ever since. Having recently been made aware of this bureau, I am submitting this claim with hope that things can be made right ; and, moreover, that someone can explain to me what seems absolutely inexplicable.",,,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1976950

I received XXXX cards in the mail in XXXX XXXX. Card XXXX was supposed to be pre-loaded with {$20.00}. Card XXXX was supposed to be pre-loaded with {$40.00}. I have never received this {$60.00} in full. 

When the cards arrived, neither of them had the correct balance that I was told they would have. The card with {$20.00} was reduced down to {$0.00} due to "" inactivity fees '' before the card was ever received or activated because it had been allegedly funded back in XXXX of XXXX. The card with {$40.00} was reduced down to {$30.00} due to "" monthly service fees '' before the card was ever received or activated because it had allegedly been funded back in XXXX of XXXX. 

The phone operators I called to request assistance were of no help trying to explain why the cards were assessed fees before they were received or activated, and informed me that the fee schedule ( 13 months of no activity ) begins when the card is funded, not when the card is received or activated. So if they send a card that 's already drained by fees, somehow this is my fault and I take the penalty for it. 

I activated the card with {$30.00} on it and attempted to make multiple purchases with the card. Despite activation, the card was declined at XXXX XXXX with a point of sale transaction, at a gas station, and with an online purchase on XXXX. When I contacted the company, they could give me no explanation for why the point of sale transactions were declined, but informed me that the online transaction was declined because activating the card was not enough -- I had to go online to a website and register the card as well. Despite multiple previous calls, no one bothered to explain this process to me at any point. 

Despite four attempts to use the card in XXXX, the card was still assessed a {$2.00} "" monthly inactivity fee. '' When I call in to check a balance, the call drops due to an error in their system, and when you call in again, you get warned that they are going to assess a {$0.00} fee because you 're calling back a second time. When you call in to customer service to figure out why the card keeps on declining AFTER you activated it, not only do they not give you a straight answer until the THIRD call, but they assess you an a {$1.00} fee to give you incorrect information. 

These issues are beyond misleading and deceptive. The fee structure is ridiculously complex and hits you for everything you do to try to use the card, and the fact that they take money from you before you 've even received the cards is outright theft.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,Yes,2321590

Unknowing of the dangers and known risk of that area, I opened a tab at a local bar/restaurant. My credit card remained in the bar tender 's possession approximately 3-5 hours. I did not submit fraudulent claims for 3 other transactions made that day because they were transaction that I made. The next day, I received a notice from my bank, Navy Federal Credit Union ( NFCU ) which notified me of the {$830.00} dollar transaction that was made on my account. It asked whether the transaction was made by me, and it was not to reply with a 'no ' to the text message. I immediately replied with the obvious no. Once logging into my account, I noticed two separate transactions made at an ATM machine. I once again immediately notified my bank. Since I 'm stationed a few hours south of XXXX, and the nearest NFCU branch is 2 hours away from me, I could not make it into the bank until 4 days later. While at the branch, the bank teller deposed of the card in which the fraudulent transactions were made, and issued me a new one. Additionally, she initiated a claim only for the two ATM transactions since they had already posted to my account. They issued me a provisional refund for the two ATM transactions. She advised to contact NFCU via phone once the {$830.00} transaction posted to my account to initiate a separate claim. Once the transaction posted to my account, I contacted NFCU and initiated the claim. The representative who took the claim, annotate vague and information that lacked detail which could have painted a better picture for the investigator. I found out about the notes that were taken on the account because they were read back to me once I called to get an update on the claim. 
I noted to the person who took the claim, that I attempted to notify the XXXX authorities, but was advised that they were unable to do anything since the incident was a civil matter. After doing some research, there were several warnings posted by the XXXX of similar cased involving fraudulent transactions and service members being "" drugged '', and mugged. I tried to relay this information to the person taking the claim, but she was uninterested of the additional detailed and just wanted the basics. She also advised me that a provisional credit was going to be issued within 48 hours. When I asked for a good time to follow back on the claim, she stated that the investigator would not be available until to following XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), due to the holiday break. This was on ot about XX/XX/XXXX. When I finally called back XX/XX/XXXX to get an update on the claim and inquire on the status of the provisional credit I was advised by another representative that he was unable to get me details on the account and that I needed to call back to following day to speak to my fraud investigator on my case. The representative who took the called asked if I wanted to leave a message for my investigator ; which I did. I asked the representative to relay to the investigator that I was XXXX, and did n't have reliable cell phone as a means for communication. Additionally, I requested that the investigator send me an email so that I can move to a location where I could call him. I never received that email. The following day, I called back and was advised by another representative that my claim was denied. Bases for being denied : since there was a chip available on my card, and because the chip is designed to prevent fraudulent transaction like the one I reported, that the claim was denied. 
There were no documentation or information provided to me which demonstrated that Navy Federal Credit Union 's investigation was conducive to a bank who looks out for their customer 's best interest.

Now, I have submitted new tax documentation from the county and the Veteran 's Affair 's Office showing that I am a XXXX veteran. My initial contact was at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and did not receive a response for ten days. Following that, I responded with the same said documents via email. I never heard anything back which prompted me to call them mid-XX/XX/XXXX. After speaking to a representative, he assured me my escrow analysis was be performed by XX/XX/2017. In addition to that, he made sure all of my documents were in order. XX/XX/XXXX comes and goes and there was still no update to my escrow payment nor an escrow analysis performed. I called in again since they never responded to my emails nor my secure messages through their website. I was told the documents I sent in were a blank check and a homestead exemption form. I sent neither of those documents in. Plus, the blank check was for a bank that I am not a member of. I, again, emailed the same documents to the email address provided. There has not been any sort of contact attempts to me to let me know that I either sent in right or wrong documents.
